We introduce NPBDREG, a fully non-parametric Bayesian framework for uncertainty estimation in DNN-based deformable image registration by  combining an Adam optimizer with stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) to characterize the underlying posterior distribution through posterior sampling.\nThus, it has the potential to provide uncertainty estimates that are highly correlated with the presence of out of distribution data. We demonstrated the added-value of NPBDREG, compared to the baseline probabilistic VoxelMorph model (PrVXM), on brain MRI image registration using 390 image pairs from four publicly available databases: MGH10, CMUC12, ISBR18 and LPBA40. \nThe NPBDREG shows  a better correlation of the predicted uncertainty with out-of-distribution data (r>0.95 vs. r<0.5) as well as a 7.3%  improvement in the registration accuracy (Dice score, 0.74 vs. 0.69, p<0.01), and a 18% improvement in registration smoothness  (percentage of folds in the deformation field, 0.014 vs. 0.017, p < 0.01). \nFinally, NPBDREG demonstrated a better generalization capability for data corrupted by a mixed structure noise (Dice score of 0.73 vs. 0.69, p<<0.01) compared to the baseline PrVXM approach.\n  \n  ---\n  ### A blocks diagram of the system\n<img src=\"images/system.JPG\" width=\"600\" />\n \n", "original_header": "NPBDREG: Uncertainty Assessment in Diffeomorphic Brain MRI Registration using a Non-parametric Bayesian Deep-Learning Based Approach"}, "confidence": 0.9987602049478667, "technique": "supervised_classification", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samahkh/NPBDREG_prj/main/README.md"}], "full_title": [{"result": {"type": "String", "value": "NPBDREG: Uncertainty Assessment in Diffeomorphic Brain MRI Registration using a Non-parametric Bayesian Deep-Learning Based Approach"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samahkh/NPBDREG_prj/main/README.md"}], "image": [{"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samahkh/NPBDREG_prj/main/images/system.JPG"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samahkh/NPBDREG_prj/main/README.md"}]}
