Build and install the CLIF backend. If you use\n    [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) instead of `make` your build will go\n    significantly faster. It is used by Chromium, LLVM et al. Look at\n    `INSTALL.sh` for the directory setup and proper ...flags... to supply the\n    `cmake` command here:\n\n    ```bash\n    mkdir build\n    cd build\n    cmake ...flags... $CLIFSRC_DIR\n    make clif-matcher\n    make install\n    ```\n\n    Replace the cmake and make commands with these to use Ninja:\n\n    ```bash\n    cmake -G Ninja ...flags... $CLIFSRC_DIR\n    ninja clif-matcher\n    ninja -j 2 install\n    ```\n\n    If you have more than one Python version installed (eg. python3.8 and\n    python3.9) cmake may have problems finding python libraries for the Python\n    you specified as INSTALL.sh argument and uses the default Python instead. To\n    help cmake use the correct Python add the following options to the cmake\n    command (substitute the correct path for your system):\n\n    ```bash\n    cmake ... \\\n      -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=\"/usr/include/python3.9\" \\\n      -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=\"/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.9m.so\" \\\n      -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=\"/usr/bin/python3.9\" \\\n      \"${CMAKE_G_FLAGS[@]}\" \"$CLIFSRC_DIR\"\n    ```\n\n1.  Get back to your CLIF python checkout and install it using pip.\n\n    ```bash\n    cd \"$CLIFSRC_DIR\"\n    cp \"$BUILD_DIR/clif/protos/ast_pb2.py\" clif/protos/\n    cp \"$BUILD_DIR/clif/python/utils/proto_util.cc\" clif/python/utils/\n    cp \"$BUILD_DIR/clif/python/utils/proto_util_clif.h\" clif/python/utils/\n    cp \"$BUILD_DIR/clif/python/utils/proto_util.init.cc\" clif/python/utils/\n    pip install .\n    ```\n\nThat version is guaranteed to work. Older versions likely do not work (they lack\nsome APIs); later versions might work, at your own risk.\n\nINSTALL.sh will build and install clif-matcher to CMake install directory and\nCLIF for Python to the given Python (virtual) environment.\n\nTo run Python CLIF use `pyclif`.\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Building", "parent_header": ["C++ Language Interface Foundation (CLIF)", "Installation"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/clif/main/README.md"}, {"result": {"value": "First, try some examples:\n\n```bash\ncd examples\nless README.md\n```\n\nNext, read the [Python CLIF User Manual](clif/python/README.md).\n\nFor more details please refer to:\n\n1.

We use [Clang (LLVM's C++ compiler)](http://llvm.org/) to parse C++ headers,\n    so make sure Clang and LLVM version 11 is available. On Ubuntu and\n    Debian, you can install the prebuilt version from https://apt.llvm.org.\n\n 1. You must have [abseil-cpp](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp) installed.\n\n 1. We use [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest) for unit testing\n    C++ libraries.\n\nFor references, there is a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/google/clif/blob/main/Dockerfile)\nrunning an Ubuntu image with all the prerequisites already installed.

Build and install the CLIF backend. If you use\n    [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) instead of `make` your build will go\n    significantly faster. It is used by Chromium, LLVM et al. Look at\n    `INSTALL.sh` for the directory setup and proper ...flags... to supply the\n    `cmake` command here:\n\n    ```bash\n    mkdir build\n    cd build\n    cmake ...flags... $CLIFSRC_DIR\n    make clif-matcher\n    make install\n    ```\n\n    Replace the cmake and make commands with these to use Ninja:\n\n    ```bash\n    cmake -G Ninja ...flags... $CLIFSRC_DIR\n    ninja clif-matcher\n    ninja -j 2 install\n    ```\n\n    If you have more than one Python version installed (eg. python3.8 and\n    python3.9) cmake may have problems finding python libraries for the Python\n    you specified as INSTALL.sh argument and uses the default Python instead. To\n    help cmake use the correct Python add the following options to the cmake\n    command (substitute the correct path for your system):\n\n    ```bash\n    cmake ... \\\n      -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=\"/usr/include/python3.9\" \\\n      -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=\"/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.9m.so\" \\\n      -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=\"/usr/bin/python3.9\" \\\n      \"${CMAKE_G_FLAGS[@]}\" \"$CLIFSRC_DIR\"\n    ```\n\n1.  Get back to your CLIF python checkout and install it using pip.\n\n    ```bash\n    cd \"$CLIFSRC_DIR\"\n    cp \"$BUILD_DIR/clif/protos/ast_pb2.py\" clif/protos/\n    cp \"$BUILD_DIR/clif/python/utils/proto_util.cc\" clif/python/utils/\n    cp \"$BUILD_DIR/clif/python/utils/proto_util_clif.h\" clif/python/utils/\n    cp \"$BUILD_DIR/clif/python/utils/proto_util.init.cc\" clif/python/utils/\n    pip install .\n    ```\n\nThat version is guaranteed to work. Older versions likely do not work (they lack\nsome APIs); later versions might work, at your own risk.\n\nINSTALL.sh will build and install clif-matcher to CMake install directory and\nCLIF for Python to the given Python (virtual) environment.\n\nTo run Python CLIF use `pyclif`.\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Building", "parent_header": ["C++ Language Interface Foundation (CLIF)", "Installation"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/clif/main/README.md"}], "full_title": [{"result": {"type": "String", "value": "C++ Language Interface Foundation (CLIF)"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/clif/main/README.md"}]}
