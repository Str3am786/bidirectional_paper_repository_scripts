An understanding of these concepts helps\nthe programmer correctly reason about even the most-complicated time-programming\nchallenges and produce the simplest possible solutions.]* \nThere are two main ways to think about time in a computer program: as *absolute\ntime*, and as *civil time*. Both have their uses and it is important to\nunderstand when each is appropriate. Absolute and civil times may be converted\nback and forth using a *time zone* &mdash; this is the only way to correctly\nconvert between them. Let us now look more deeply at the three main concepts of\ntime programming: Absolute Time, Civil Time, and Time Zone. \n*Absolute time* uniquely and universally represents a specific instant in time.\nIt has no notion of calendars, or dates, or times of day. Instead, it is a\nmeasure of the passage of real time, typically as a simple count of ticks since\nsome epoch. Absolute times are independent of all time zones and do not suffer\nfrom human-imposed complexities such as daylight-saving time (DST). Many C++\ntypes exist to represent absolute times, classically `time_t` and more recently\n`std::chrono::time_point`. \n*Civil time* is the legally recognized representation of time for ordinary\naffairs (cf. https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/civil). It is a\nhuman-scale representation of time that consists of the six fields &mdash; year,\nmonth, day, hour, minute, and second (sometimes shortened to \"YMDHMS\") &mdash;\nand it follows the rules of the Proleptic Gregorian Calendar, with 24-hour days\ndivided into 60-minute hours and 60-second minutes. Like absolute times, civil\ntimes are also independent of all time zones and their related complexities\n(e.g., DST). While `std::tm` contains the six civil-time fields (YMDHMS), plus a\nfew more, it does not have behavior to enforce the rules of civil time. \n*Time zones* are geo-political regions within which human-defined rules are\nshared to convert between the absolute-time and civil-time domains. A time\nzone's rules include things like the region's offset from the UTC time standard,\ndaylight-saving adjustments, and short abbreviation strings. Time zones often\nhave a history of disparate rules that apply only for certain periods, because\nthe rules may change at the whim of a region's local government. For this\nreason, time-zone rules are usually compiled into data snapshots that are used\nat runtime to perform conversions between absolute and civil times. There is\ncurrently no C++ standard library supporting arbitrary time zones. \nIn order for programmers to reason about and program applications that correctly\ndeal with these concepts, they must have a library that correctly implements the\nabove concepts. CCTZ adds to the existing C++11 `<chrono>` library to fully\nimplement the above concepts. \n*   Absolute time &mdash;\u00a0This is implemented by the existing C++11\n    [`<chrono>`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono) library without\n    modification. For example, an absolute point in time is represented by a\n    `std::chrono::time_point`.\n*   Civil time &mdash;\u00a0This is implemented by the\n    [`include/cctz/civil_time.h`](https://github.com/google/cctz/blob/master/include/cctz/civil_time.h)\n    library that is provided as part of CCTZ. For example, a \"date\" is\n    represented by a `cctz::civil_day`.\n*   Time zone &mdash;\u00a0This is implemented by the\n    [`include/cctz/time_zone.h`](https://github.com/google/cctz/blob/master/include/cctz/time_zone.h)\n    library that is provided as part of CCTZ. For example, a time zone is\n    represented by an instance of the class `cctz::time_zone`.\n \n", "original_header": "Fundamental Concepts"}, "confidence": 0.9754946267643234, "technique":
