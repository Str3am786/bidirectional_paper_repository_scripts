Examples of\nrepresenting a project or community include using an official project e-mail\naddress, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed\nrepresentative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be\nfurther defined and clarified by project maintainers.\n\nThis Code of Conduct also applies outside the project spaces when the Project\nSteward has a reasonable belief that an individual's behavior may have a\nnegative impact on the project or its community.\n\n## Conflict Resolution\n\nWe do not believe that all conflict is bad; healthy debate and disagreement\noften yield positive results. However, it is never okay to be disrespectful or\nto engage in behavior that violates the project\u2019s code of conduct.\n\nIf you see someone violating the code of conduct, you are encouraged to address\nthe behavior directly with those involved. Many issues can be resolved quickly\nand easily, and this gives people more control over the outcome of their\ndispute. If you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the\nbehavior is threatening or harassing, report it. We are dedicated to providing\nan environment where participants feel welcome and safe.\n\nReports should be directed to *googleapis-stewards@google.com*, the\nProject Steward(s) for *Google Cloud Client Libraries*. It is the Project Steward\u2019s duty to\nreceive and address reported violations of the code of conduct. They will then\nwork with a committee consisting of representatives from the Open Source\nPrograms Office and the Google Open Source Strategy team. If for any reason you\nare uncomfortable reaching out to the Project Steward, please email\nopensource@google.com.\n\nWe will investigate every complaint, but you may not receive a direct response.\nWe will use our discretion in determining when and how to follow up on reported\nincidents, which may range from not taking action to permanent expulsion from\nthe project and project-sponsored spaces. We will notify the accused of the\nreport and provide them an opportunity to discuss it before any action is taken.\nThe identity of the reporter will be omitted from the details of the report\nsupplied to the accused. In potentially harmful situations, such as ongoing\nharassment or threats to anyone's safety, we may take action without notice.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4,\navailable at\nhttps://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/googleapis/repo-automation-bots/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md"}], "readme_url": [{"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/googleapis/repo-automation-bots/main/README.md", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}], "contributing_guidelines": [{"result": {"value": "# How to become a contributor and submit your own code\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n* [Contributor License Agreements](#contributor-license-agreements)\n* [Contributing a patch](#contributing-a-patch)\n* [Running the tests](#running-the-tests)\n* [Releasing the library](#releasing-the-library)\n\n## Contributor License Agreements\n\nWe'd love to accept your sample apps and patches!
