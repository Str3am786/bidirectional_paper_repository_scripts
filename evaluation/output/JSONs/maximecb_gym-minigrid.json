The class `minigrid_env.MiniGridEnv.Actions` is removed since it is the same as `minigrid.core.actions.Actions`.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Documentation Updates\t\r\n- For the `MiniGrid-DoorKey-6x6-v0` environment, a hidden variable determining the size was wrong at 5x5, this is updated to 6x6.\r\nhttps://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Minigrid/pull/322 \r\n- Since the class `minigrid_env.MiniGridEnv.Actions` is the same as `minigrid.core.actions.Actions`, to make the codebase cleaner, we have deleted the class `minigrid_env.MiniGridEnv.Actions`. This is a breaking change. For any code that relies on `minigrid_env.MiniGridEnv.Actions`, you can simply replace it with `minigrid.core.actions.Actions`.\r\nhttps://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Minigrid/pull/328 \r\n- In `SymbolicObsWrapper`, the grid that records the content of each tile is formatted as `[x, y, item]`, which corresponds to `[col, row, item]`, this causes a mismatch in the observation. This mismatch is now resolved.\r\nhttps://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Minigrid/pull/331 \r\n- The documentation for the rewards has previously incorrectly stated that the reward is 1 when the environment is solved, while it is actually `1 - 0.9 * (step_count / max_steps)`. Additionally, in `GoToObjectEnv`, there was an error in detecting whether the agent is next to the target. These issues have now been resolved.\r\nhttps://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Minigrid/pull/333 \r\n- Previously Minigrid relied on a Matplotlib-based rendering backend. We have added a Pygame-based rendering backend that is faster and more consistent with other Farama libraries. As a result, `minigrid.utils.window.Window` has been removed. \r\nhttps://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Minigrid/pull/313\r\n- In the `ObstructedMaze` environments, the blocking ball placed by `add_door` may cover the box placed on the map by the previous `add_door`, causing the agent to be unable to open certain doors and complete the task. We have updated several of the `ObstructedMaze` environments to be always solvable and are registered as `v1` versions of the environment. \r\nhttps://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Minigrid/pull/334\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Minigrid/tarball/v2.2.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Minigrid/zipball/v2.2.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Minigrid/releases/tag/v2.2.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Minigrid/releases/96642463", "release_id": 96642463, "date_created": "2023-03-22T14:12:10Z", "date_published": "2023-03-23T14:18:33Z"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Minigrid/releases/93809925", "tag": "v2.1.1", "name": "Version 2.1.1", "author": {"name": "pseudo-rnd-thoughts", "type": "User"}, "description": "## Bug Fixes and Documentation Updates\t\r\n* Added Docstrings to the BabyAI environments by @BolunDai0216 in https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Minigrid/pull/302\r\n* Fixed entry point typo for MiniGrid-SimpleCrossingS11N5-v0 by @jbloomAus in https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Minigrid/pull/306\r\n* Fixed not changing view size bug in ViewSizeWrapper @jbloomAus in https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Minigrid/pull/305\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/minigrid/compare/v2.1.0...v2.1.1", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Minigrid/tarball/v2.1.1", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Minigrid/zipball/v2.1.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Minigrid/releases/tag/v2.1.1", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Minigrid/releases/93809925", "release_id": 93809925, "date_created": "2023-02-27T15:37:50Z", "date_published": "2023-02-27T15:38:07Z"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/Farama-Foundation/Minigrid/releases/82919003", "tag": "v2.1.0", "name": "Version 2.1.0", "author": {"name": "rodrigodelazcano", "type": "User"}, "description": "## What's Changed\r\n* Added new [BabyAI](https://github.com/mila-iqia/babyai) level environments. @saleml \r\n* New documentation website at https://minigrid.farama.org/ @SiddarGu @mgoulao. @jjshoots \r\n*  Update security permissions for GitHub workflows. #252 @andrewtanJS  \r\n* Refactor `manual_control.py`. @MathisFederico \r\n* Fix issue with making all environments pickable #269. @MathisFederico\r\n* Include `max_steps` argument in all of the environments.
