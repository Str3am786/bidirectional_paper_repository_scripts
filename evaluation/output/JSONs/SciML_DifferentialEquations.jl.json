The\npurpose of this package is to supply efficient Julia implementations of solvers\nfor various differential equations. Equations within the realm of this package\ninclude: \n- Discrete equations (function maps, discrete stochastic (Gillespie/Markov)\n  simulations)\n- Ordinary differential equations (ODEs)\n- Split and Partitioned ODEs (Symplectic integrators, IMEX Methods)\n- Stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs or SDEs)\n- Stochastic differential-algebraic equations (SDAEs)\n- Random differential equations (RODEs or RDEs)\n- Differential algebraic equations (DAEs)\n- Delay differential equations (DDEs)\n- Neutral, retarded, and algebraic delay differential equations (NDDEs, RDDEs, and DDAEs)\n- Stochastic delay differential equations (SDDEs)\n- Experimental support for stochastic neutral, retarded, and algebraic delay differential equations (SNDDEs, SRDDEs, and SDDAEs)\n- Mixed discrete and continuous equations (Hybrid Equations, Jump Diffusions)\n- (Stochastic) partial differential equations ((S)PDEs) (with both finite\n  difference and finite element methods)\n  \nThe well-optimized DifferentialEquations solvers benchmark as some of the fastest\nimplementations of classic algorithms. It also includes algorithms from recent\nresearch which routinely outperform the \"standard\" C/Fortran methods, and algorithms\noptimized for high-precision and HPC applications. Simultaneously, it wraps\nthe classic C/Fortran methods, making it easy to switch over to them whenever\nnecessary. Solving differential equations with different methods from\ndifferent languages and packages can be done by changing one line of code,\nallowing for easy benchmarking to ensure you are using the fastest method possible. \nDifferentialEquations.jl integrates with the Julia package sphere with: \n- GPU acceleration through [CUDA.jl](https://cuda.juliagpu.org/stable/) and [DiffEqGPU.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqGPU/dev/)\n- Automated sparsity detection with [Symbolics.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/Symbolics.jl)\n- Automatic Jacobian coloring with [SparseDiffTools.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/SparseDiffTools/stable/), allowing for fast solutions\n  to problems with sparse or structured (Tridiagonal, Banded, BlockBanded, etc.) Jacobians\n- Allowing the specification of linear solvers for maximal efficiency with [LinearSolve.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/LinearSolve/stable/)\n- Progress meter integration with the Visual Studio Code IDE for estimated time to solution\n- Automatic plotting of time series and phase plots\n- Built-in interpolations\n- Wraps for common C/Fortran methods like Sundials and Hairer's radau\n- Arbitrary precision with BigFloats and Arbfloats\n- Arbitrary array types, allowing the definition of differential equations on\n  matrices and distributed arrays\n- Unit checked arithmetic with Unitful \nAdditionally, DifferentialEquations.jl comes with built-in analysis features, including: \n- [Forward and Adjoint Sensitivity Analysis (Automatic Differentiation)](https://docs.sciml.ai/SciMLSensitivity/stable/) for fast gradient computations\n- [Parameter Estimation and Bayesian Analysis](https://docs.sciml.ai/Overview/stable/highlevels/inverse_problems/)\n- Neural differential equations with [DiffEqFlux.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqFlux/stable/)\n  for efficient scientific machine learning (scientific ML) and scientific AI.\n- Automatic distributed, multithreaded, and GPU [Parallel Ensemble Simulations](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/dev/features/ensemble/)\n- [Global Sensitivity Analysis](https://docs.sciml.ai/GlobalSensitivity/stable/)\n- [Uncertainty Quantification](https://docs.sciml.ai/Overview/stable/highlevels/uncertainty_quantification/) \nThis gives a powerful mixture of speed and productivity features to help you\nsolve and analyze your differential equations faster. \nFor information on using the package,\n[see the stable documentation](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/).
