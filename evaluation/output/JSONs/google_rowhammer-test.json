This\nrepo contains a program for testing for the rowhammer problem which\nruns as a normal userland process.\n\nThe rowhammer problem is described by:\n\n* Yoongu Kim et al's paper, \"[Flipping Bits in Memory Without\n  Accessing Them: An Experimental Study of DRAM Disturbance\n  Errors](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~yoonguk/papers/kim-isca14.pdf)\"\n  (2014).\n\n* Our blog post, \"[Exploiting the DRAM rowhammer bug to gain kernel\n  privileges](http://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/03/exploiting-dram-rowhammer-bug-to-gain.html)\"\n  (2015), on the blog of Google's Project Zero.\n\nHow to run the test:\n\n```\n./make.sh\n./rowhammer_test\n```\n\nThe test should work on Linux or Mac OS X.  It works on x86 only\n(either x86-32 or x86-64), because it relies on x86's `CLFLUSH`\ninstruction for flushing cache lines.\n\n**Warning #1:** We are providing this code as-is.  You are responsible\nfor protecting yourself, your property and data, and others from any\nrisks caused by this code.  This code may cause unexpected and\nundesirable behavior to occur on your machine.  This code may not\ndetect the vulnerability on your machine.\n\nBe careful not to run this test on machines that contain important\ndata.  On machines that are susceptible to the rowhammer problem, this\ntest could cause bit flips that crash the machine, or worse, cause bit\nflips in data that gets written back to disc.\n\n**Warning #2:** If you find that a computer is susceptible to the\nrowhammer problem, you may want to avoid using it as a multi-user\nsystem.  Bit flips caused by row hammering breach the CPU's memory\nprotection.  On a machine that is susceptible to the rowhammer\nproblem, one process can corrupt pages used by other processes or by\nthe kernel.\n\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Program for testing for the DRAM \"rowhammer\" problem"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/rowhammer-test/master/README.md"}, {"result": {"value": "We invite people to post results from this test on the following\nmailing list:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/group/rowhammer-discuss/\n\nThis mailing list is intended to be used for:\n\n* Reporting experimental results.\n* Discussing avenues of exploitation for rowhammer-induced bit flips.\n* Discussing mitigations.\n* Any other discussion of the rowhammer problem.\n\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Mailing list", "parent_header": ["Program for testing for the DRAM \"rowhammer\" problem"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/rowhammer-test/master/README.md"}, {"result": {"value": "A row hammering attempt involves picking two or more memory locations\nand then accessing them, uncached, repeatedly.  If the locations are\nin different rows of DRAM but in the same bank, this will cause the\nrows to be activated repeatedly.  It is these repeated row activations\nthat can cause bit flips in adjacent rows.\n\nWe use a probabilistic approach for picking memory locations: We can\nsimply pick random pairs of addresses, and retry repeatedly.  If a\nmachine has 16 banks of DRAM, there should be a 1/16 chance that the\ntwo addresses chosen map to the same bank.  (For example, some\nmachines that I've tested contain 2 DRAM modules with 8 banks each.)\n\nThis probabilistic approach means that the test doesn't need to know\nhow the CPU's memory controller maps physical addresses to DRAM row\nand column numbers, and it doesn't need to know the physical addresses\nof the memory it has allocated.\n\nThe test allocates a large block of memory.  It repeatedly picks >2\nrandom addresses within the block, hammers them, and then checks the\nblock for bit flips.  If it sees a bit flip, it exits.  If it never\nsees a bit flip, it will run forever.\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "How the test works", "parent_header": ["Program for testing for the DRAM \"rowhammer\" problem"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/rowhammer-test/master/README.md"}], "full_title": [{"result": {"type": "String", "value": "Program for testing for the DRAM \"rowhammer\" problem"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/rowhammer-test/master/README.md"}]}
