In this method, the Dropout\nlayer is used both in training and test time. By running the model multiple times whilst randomly dropping weights, we\ncalculate the uncertainty of the prediction using one of the uncertainty measurements\nin [heuristics.py](baal/active/heuristics/heuristics.py). \nThe framework consists of four main parts, as demonstrated in the flowchart below: \nTo get started, wrap your dataset in our _[**ActiveLearningDataset**](baal/active/dataset.py)_ class. This will ensure\nthat the dataset is split into\n`training` and `pool` sets. The `pool` set represents the portion of the training set which is yet to be labelled. \nWe provide a lightweight object _[**ModelWrapper**](baal/modelwrapper.py)_ similar to `keras.Model` to make it easier to\ntrain and test the model. If your model is not ready for active learning, we provide Modules to prepare them. \nFor example, the _[**MCDropoutModule**](baal/bayesian/dropout.py)_ wrapper changes the existing dropout layer to be used\nin both training and inference time and the `ModelWrapper` makes the specifies the number of iterations to run at\ntraining and inference. \nIn conclusion, your script should be similar to this:\n```python\ndataset = ActiveLearningDataset(your_dataset)\ndataset.label_randomly(INITIAL_POOL)  # label some data\nmodel = MCDropoutModule(your_model)\nmodel = ModelWrapper(model, your_criterion)\nactive_loop = ActiveLearningLoop(dataset,\n                                 get_probabilities=model.predict_on_dataset,\n                                 heuristic=heuristics.BALD(),\n                                 iterations=20, # Number of MC sampling.\n                                 query_size=QUERY_SIZE)  # Number of item to label.\nfor al_step in range(N_ALSTEP):\n    model.train_on_dataset(dataset, optimizer, BATCH_SIZE, use_cuda=use_cuda)\n    metrics = model.test_on_dataset(test_dataset, BATCH_SIZE)\n    # Label the next most uncertain items.\n    if not active_loop.step():\n        # We're done!\n        break\n```\n \n", "original_header": "Baal Framework"}, "confidence": 0.8969584942903353, "technique": "supervised_classification", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElementAI/baal/master/README.md"}, {"result": {"type": "Text_excerpt", "value": "The Baal team tests and implements the most recent papers on uncertainty estimation and active learning. \n", "original_header": "Who We Are!"}, "confidence": 0.8598319767163287, "technique": "supervised_classification", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElementAI/baal/master/README.md"}, {"result": {"type": "Text_excerpt", "value": "\nBaal is an active learning library that supports both industrial applications and research usecases. \nOur paper can be read on .

`ActiveLearningDataset` now has better support for attributes specifics to the pool (see below).\r\n* More flexible support multi-inputs/outputs in `ModelWrapper`.\r\n    * Can support list of inputs or outputs. \r\n* QoL features on `ActiveLearningDataset`\r\n    * Can use a RandomState and add `load_state_dict`.\r\n* Add `replicate_in_memory` flag to `ModelWrapper`.\r\n    * If False, the MC iterations are done in a for-loop instead of making a batch in memory.\r\n    * (This means `predict_on_batch` would not take up more memory than e.g. `test_on_batch`)\r\n* Add `patience` and `min_epoch_for_es` to `ModelWrapper.train_and_test_on_datasets`.\r\n    * Allows early stopping.\r\n* New [tutorial](https://baal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sklearn_tutorial.html)  on how to use BaaL with scikit-learn. \r\n* Can now combine heuristics for multi-outputs models (see baal.active.heuristics.Combine).\r\n* Fix documentation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### New ActiveLearningDataset\r\n\r\nTo better support new tasks, `ActiveLearningDataset` can now support any attributes to be overrided when the pool is created.\r\n\r\n**Example**:\r\n```python\r\nfrom PIL import Image\r\nfrom torch.utils.data import Dataset\r\nfrom torchvision.transforms import Compose, ToTensor, RandomHorizontalFlip\r\nfrom baal.active.dataset import ActiveLearningDataset\r\n\r\n\r\nclass MyDataset(Dataset):\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        self.my_tansforms = Compose([RandomHorizontalFlip(), ToTensor()])\r\n        \r\n    def __len__(self):\r\n        return 10\r\n        \r\n    def __getitem__(self, idx):\r\n        x = Image.open('an_image.png')\r\n        return self.my_tansforms(x)\r\n        \r\nal_dataset = ActiveLearningDataset(MyDataset(),\r\n
