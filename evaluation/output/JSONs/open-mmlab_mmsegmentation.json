release", "author": {"name": "xiexinch", "type": "User"}, "description": "# v1.0.0(04/06/2023)\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\nWe are excited to announce the release of MMSegmentation v1.0.0 as a part of the OpenMMLab 2.0 project! MMSegmentation v1.0.0 introduces an updated framework structure for the core package and a new section called \"Projects\". This section showcases a range of engaging and versatile applications built upon the MMSegmentation foundation.\r\n\r\n![mmseg_release drawio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15952744/232992595-33136742-3f07-4110-91c9-bcc0894ed82e.png)\r\n\r\nIn this latest release, we have significantly refactored the core package's code to make it clearer, more comprehensible, and disentangled. This has resulted in improved performance for several existing algorithms, ensuring that they now outperform their previous versions. Additionally, we have incorporated some cutting-edge algorithms, such as PIDNet and SegNeXt, to further enhance the capabilities of MMSegmentation and provide users with a more comprehensive and powerful toolkit.\r\nThe new \"Projects\" section serves as an essential addition to MMSegmentation, created to foster innovation and collaboration among users. \r\n\r\n## Exciting Features\r\n\r\n### Inferencer\r\n\r\nIn this release, we introduce the MMSegInferencer, a versatile API for inference that accommodates multiple input types. The API enables users to easily specify and customize semantic segmentation models, streamlining the process of performing semantic segmentation with MMSegmentation.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\npython demo/image_demo_with_inferencer.py ${IMAGE} ${MODEL} --show --device ${DEVICE}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Optimizations\r\n\r\nIn addition to new features, MMSegmentation v1.0.0 delivers key optimizations for an enhanced user experience.\r\n\r\n### PyTorch 2.0 Compatibility\r\n\r\nMMSegmentation v1.0.0 is now compatible with PyTorch 2.0, ensuring that users can leverage the latest features and performance improvements offered by the PyTorch 2.0 framework when using MMSegmentation. With the integration of inductor, users can expect faster model speeds. The table below shows several example models:\r\n\r\n| Model | Training Speed |\r\n|:-----:|:-----------:|\r\n|pspnet_r50-d8|34.0% \u2b06\ufe0f (0.3474 -> 0.2293)|\r\n|segformer_mit-b2|7.12% \u2b06\ufe0f (0.1798 -> 0.1670)|\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n\r\nNew features from v1.0.0rc6 to v1.0.0 include:\r\n\r\n- Add Mapillary Vistas Datasets support to MMSegmentation Core Package

"description": "We are excited to announce the release of MMSegmentation 1.0.0rc0. MMSeg 1.0.0rc0 is the first version of MMSegmentation 1.x, a part of the OpenMMLab 2.0 projects. Built upon the new [training engine](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmengine), MMSeg 1.x unifies the interfaces of dataset, models, evaluation, and visualization with faster training and testing speed.\r\n\r\n### Highlights\r\n\r\n1. **New engines** MMSeg 1.x is based on [MMEngine](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmengine), which provides a general and powerful runner that allows more flexible customizations and significantly simplifies the entrypoints of high-level interfaces.\r\n\r\n2. **Unified interfaces** As a part of the OpenMMLab 2.0 projects, MMSeg 1.x unifies and refactors the interfaces and internal logics of train, testing, datasets, models, evaluation, and visualization. All the OpenMMLab 2.0 projects share the same design in those interfaces and logics to allow the emergence of multi-task/modality algorithms.\r\n\r\n3. **Faster speed** We optimize the training and inference speed for common models.\r\n\r\n4. **New features**:\r\n\r\n   - Support TverskyLoss function\r\n\r\n5. **More documentation and tutorials**. We add a bunch of documentation and tutorials to help users get started more smoothly. Read it [here](https://mmsegmentation.readthedocs.io/en/1.x/).\r\n\r\n### Breaking Changes\r\n\r\nWe briefly list the major breaking changes here.\r\nWe will update the [migration guide](../migration.md) to provide complete details and migration instructions.\r\n\r\n#### Training and testing\r\n\r\n- MMSeg 1.x runs on PyTorch>=1.6. We have deprecated the support of PyTorch 1.5 to embrace the mixed precision training and other new features since PyTorch 1.6. Some models can still run on PyTorch 1.5, but the full functionality of MMSeg 1.x is not guaranteed.\r\n\r\n- MMSeg 1.x uses Runner in [MMEngine](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmengine) rather than that in MMCV. The new Runner implements and unifies the building logic of dataset, model, evaluation, and visualizer. Therefore, MMSeg 1.x no longer maintains the building logics of those modules in `mmseg.train.apis` and `tools/train.py`. Those code have been migrated into [MMEngine](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmengine/blob/main/mmengine/runner/runner.py). Please refer to the [migration guide of Runner in MMEngine](https://mmengine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migration/runner.html) for more details.\r\n\r\n- The Runner in MMEngine also supports testing and validation. The testing scripts are also simplified, which has similar logic as that in training scripts to build the runner.\r\n\r\n- The execution points of hooks in the new Runner have been enriched to allow more flexible customization. Please refer to the [migration guide of Hook in MMEngine](https://mmengine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migration/hook.html) for more details.\r\n\r\n- Learning rate and momentum scheduling has been migrated from `Hook` to `Parameter Scheduler` in MMEngine. Please refer to the [migration guide of Parameter Scheduler in MMEngine](https://mmengine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migration/param_scheduler.html) for more details.\r\n\r\n#### Configs\r\n\r\n- The [Runner in MMEngine](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmengine/blob/main/mmengine/runner/runner.py) uses a different config structures to ease the understanding of the components in runner. Users can read the [config example of mmseg](../user_guides/config.md) or refer to the [migration guide in MMEngine](https://mmengine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migration/runner.html) for migration details.\r\n- The file names of configs and models are also refactored to follow the new rules unified across OpenMMLab 2.0 projects. Please refer to the [user guides of config](../user_guides/1_config.md) for more details.\r\n\r\n#### Components\r\n\r\n- Dataset\r\n- Data Transforms\r\n- Model\r\n- Evaluation\r\n- Visualization\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\n- Support mixed precision training of all the models. However, some models may got Nan results due to some numerical issues. We will update the documentation and list their results (accuracy of failure) of mixed precision training.\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix several config file errors [#1994](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation/pull/1994)\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n\r\n1. Support data structures and encapsulating `seg_logits` in data samples, which can be return from models to support more common evaluation metrics.\r\n\r\n### Ongoing changes\r\n\r\n1. Test-time augmentation: which is supported in MMSeg 0.x is not implemented in this version due to limited time slot. We will support it in the following releases with a new and simplified design.\r\n\r\n2. Inference interfaces: a unified inference interfaces will be supported in the future to ease the use of released models.\r\n\r\n3. Interfaces of useful tools that can be used in notebook: more useful tools that implemented in the `tools` directory will have their python interfaces so that they can be used through notebook and in downstream libraries.\r\n\r\n4. Documentation: we will add more design docs, tutorials, and migration guidance so that the community can deep dive into our new design, participate the future development, and smoothly migrate downstream libraries to MMSeg 1.x.\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation/tarball/v1.0.0rc0", "zipball_url":
