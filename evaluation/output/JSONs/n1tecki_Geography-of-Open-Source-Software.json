In the first step, the usernames of Github contributors are extracted from the provided commit information. The [`Williams_Method.py`](https://github.com/n1tecki/Geography-of-Open-Source-Software/blob/main/code/Williams_Method.py) script takes a CSV file containing commit SHAs of relevant users and calls it via the Github API. The author of that commit is then traced and his username exported into a CSV file. Commits that could not be traced to the author or no longer exist are exported into a separate CSV. To check for redundancies, the [`Redundance_Processing.py`](https://github.com/n1tecki/Geography-of-Open-Source-Software/blob/main/code/Redundance_Processing.py) code makes sure each username is unique. <br /><br />\n2. **Github Data Collection** <br /> The CSV file with unique usernames is passed on to the [`Github_API.py`](https://github.com/n1tecki/Geography-of-Open-Source-Software/blob/main/code/Github_API.py) script, which calls the Github API and gathers the data of the user. Additionally, the [`graphQL_API`](https://github.com/n1tecki/Geography-of-Open-Source-Software/blob/main/code/Resources/graphQL_API.py) script is called, which additionally collects sponsor information about each user via the Github GraphQL API. The resulting data is exported as a JSON file. Usernames that could not be found or no longer exist are exported into a separate CSV file. <br /><br />\n3. **Twitter Data Collection** <br /> The [`Twitter_API.py`](https://github.com/n1tecki/Geography-of-Open-Source-Software/blob/main/code/Twitter_API.py) takes the JSON file with all the user information and calls the Twitter API to collect data about _only those users, that had a Twitter username in their Github profile._ The new data with Github as well as Twitter information is exported as a JSON file. <br /> Many location strings provided by contributors are too ambiguous. Those strings are saved in a seperate CSV file. <br /><br />\n4. **Geocoding** <br /> In this step,  the [`Github_Geocoding.py`](https://github.com/n1tecki/Geography-of-Open-Source-Software/blob/main/code/Github_Geocoding.py) and [`Twitter_Geocoding.py`](https://github.com/n1tecki/Geography-of-Open-Source-Software/blob/main/code/Twitter_Geocoding.py) scripts forward the corresponding gathered location string provided by users to the Bing Maps API in order to geolocate them. The Bing Maps API query results in three most likely location matches, each containing information about the match probability. Each match contains the country, state and city information as a string, as well as the latitude and longitude coordinates. <br /><br />\n5. **NUTS Geocoding** The JSON file with the geocoded contributors is then read by the [`NUTS_Geocoding.py`](https://github.com/n1tecki/Geography-of-Open-Source-Software/blob/main/code/Nuts_Geocoding.py) code. This code sets the appropriate NUTS codes based on the latitude and longitude coordinates for users located in Europe and exports the enriched data as a JSON file. <br /><br />\n6. **Email Suffix Geocoding** <br /> To geocode as many contributors as possible, besides looking at the user-supplied location string, the infrastructure is also programmed to try and get country level location information based on email suffixes of users. [`Email_Suffix_Geocoding.py`](https://github.com/n1tecki/Geography-of-Open-Source-Software/blob/main/code/Email_Suffix_Geocoding.py) is the script, that compares the email suffixes against a list of many university suffixes and a list of country domains to provide additional location information, exporting it as a JSON file. <br /><br /> \nThe Data Flow Diagram below summarises the geocoding infrastructure:\n \n![alt text](https://github.com/n1tecki/Geography-of-Open-Source-Software/blob/main/DFD.jpg?raw=true) \n", "original_header": "Data Collection"}, "confidence": 0.9139851205114744, "technique": "supervised_classification", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/n1tecki/Geography-of-Open-Source-Software/main/README.md"}], "full_title": [{"result": {"type": "String", "value": "Geography of Open Source Software"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/n1tecki/Geography-of-Open-Source-Software/main/README.md"}], "image": [{"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/n1tecki/Geography-of-Open-Source-Software/main/DFD.jpg?raw=true"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/n1tecki/Geography-of-Open-Source-Software/main/README.md"}]}
