other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,\nthreatening, offensive, or harmful.\n\n## Scope\n\nThis Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces\nwhen an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of\nrepresenting a project or community include using an official project e-mail\naddress, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed\nrepresentative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be\nfurther defined and clarified by project maintainers.\n\n## Enforcement\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be\nreported by contacting the project team at conduct@sourced.tech.

This document outlines some of the\nconventions on development workflow, commit message formatting, contact points,\nand other resources to make it easier to get your contribution accepted.\n\n## Certificate of Origin\n\nBy contributing to this project you agree to the [Developer Certificate of\nOrigin (DCO)](DCO). This document was created by the Linux Kernel community and is a\nsimple statement that you, as a contributor, have the legal right to make the\ncontribution.\n\nIn order to show your agreement with the DCO you should include at the end of commit message,\nthe following line: `Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>`, using your real name.\n\nThis can be done easily using the [`-s`](https://github.com/git/git/blob/b2c150d3aa82f6583b9aadfecc5f8fa1c74aca09/Documentation/git-commit.txt#L154-L161) flag on the `git commit`.\n\n\n## Support Channels\n\nThe official support channels, for both users and contributors, are:\n\n- GitHub [issues](https://github.com/src-d/hercules/issues)*\n- Slack: #machine-learning room in the [source{d} Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/sourced-community/shared_invite/enQtMjc4Njk5MzEyNzM2LTFjNzY4NjEwZGEwMzRiNTM4MzRlMzQ4MmIzZjkwZmZlM2NjODUxZmJjNDI1OTcxNDAyMmZlNmFjODZlNTg0YWM)\n\n*Before opening a new issue or submitting a new pull request, it's helpful to\nsearch the project - it's likely that another user has already reported the\nissue you're facing, or it's a known issue that we're already aware of.\n\n\n## How to Contribute\n\nPull Requests (PRs) are the main and exclusive way to contribute to the official go-git project.\nIn order for a PR to be accepted it needs to pass a list of requirements:\n\n- Code Coverage does not decrease.\n- All the tests pass.\n- Go code is idiomatic, formatted according to [gofmt](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/), and without any warnings from [go lint](https://github.com/golang/lint) nor [go vet](https://golang.org/cmd/vet/).\n- Python code is formatted according to [![PEP8](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-pep8-orange.svg)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).\n- If the PR is a bug fix, it has to include a new unit test that fails before the patch is merged.\n- If the PR is a new feature, it has to come with a suite of unit tests, that tests the new functionality.\n- In any case, all the PRs have to pass the personal evaluation of at least one of the [maintainers](MAINTAINERS.md).\n\n\n### Format of the commit message\n\nThe commit summary must start with a capital letter and with a verb in present tense. No dot in the end.\n\n```\nAdd a feature\nRemove unused code\nFix a bug\n```\n\nEvery commit details should describe what was changed, under which context and, if applicable, the GitHub issue it relates to.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/src-d/hercules/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"}]}
