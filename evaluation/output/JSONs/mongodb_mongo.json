Database Ownership\n #\n #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF\n #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work\n #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the\n #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do\n #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make\n #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ\n #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA\n #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of\n #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance\n #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made\n #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person\n #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to\n #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mongodb/mongo/master/src/third_party/icu4c-57.1/LICENSE"}, {"result": {"value": "\n                                 Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1.

You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\nor limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\nthe Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\nthe extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5.

Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\nstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\nbe placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\nSoftware under this License.

However, if You become\ncompliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\nContributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\nContributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\nongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\nnon-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\ncome back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\nYour receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3.

Please read the gRPC\norganization's [governance rules](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-community/blob/master/governance.md)\nand [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before proceeding.\n\nIf you are new to github, please start by reading [Pull Request\nhowto](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)\n\nIf you are looking for features to work on, please filter the issues list with the label [\"disposition/help wanted\"](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues?q=label%3A%22disposition%2Fhelp+wanted%22).\nPlease note that some of these feature requests might have been closed in the past as a result of them being marked as stale due to there being no activity, but these are still valid feature requests.\n\n## Legal requirements\n\nIn order to protect both you and ourselves, you will need to sign the\n[Contributor License\nAgreement](https://identity.linuxfoundation.org/projects/cncf).\n\n## Cloning the repository\n\nBefore starting any development work you will need a local copy of the gRPC repository.\nPlease follow the instructions in [Building gRPC C++: Clone the repository](BUILDING.md#clone-the-repository-including-submodules).\n\n## Building & Running tests\n\nDifferent languages use different build systems. To hide the complexity\nof needing to build with many different build systems, a portable python\nscript that unifies the experience of building and testing gRPC in different\nlanguages and on different platforms is provided.\n\nTo build gRPC in the language of choice (e.g. `c++`, `csharp`, `php`, `python`, `ruby`, ...)\n- Prepare your development environment based on language-specific instructions in `src/YOUR-LANGUAGE` directory.\n- The language-specific instructions might involve installing C/C++ prerequisites listed in\n  [Building gRPC C++: Prerequisites](BUILDING.md#pre-requisites). This is because gRPC implementations\n  in this repository are using the native gRPC \"core\" library internally.\n- Run\n  ```\n  python tools/run_tests/run_tests.py -l YOUR_LANGUAGE --build_only\n  ```\n- To also run all the unit tests after building\n  ```\n  python tools/run_tests/run_tests.py -l YOUR_LANGUAGE\n  ```\n\nYou can also run `python tools/run_tests/run_tests.py --help` to discover useful command line flags supported. For more details,\nsee [tools/run_tests](tools/run_tests) where you will also find guidance on how to run various other test suites (e.g. interop tests, benchmarks).\n\n## Generated project files\n\nTo ease maintenance of language- and platform- specific build systems, many\nprojects files are generated using templates and should not be edited by hand.\nRun `tools/buildgen/generate_projects.sh` to regenerate.  See\n[templates](templates) for details.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, if you see the \"sanity tests\" failing you've most likely\nedited generated files or you didn't regenerate the projects properly (or your\ncode formatting doesn't match our code style).\n\n## Guidelines for Pull Requests\nHow to get your contributions merged smoothly and quickly.\n \n- Create **small PRs** that are narrowly focused on **addressing a single\n  concern**.  We often times receive PRs that are trying to fix several things\n  at a time, but only one fix is considered acceptable, nothing gets merged and\n  both author's & review's time is wasted.  Create more PRs to address different\n  concerns and everyone will be happy.\n \n- For speculative changes, consider opening an issue and discussing it first.\n  If you are suggesting a behavioral or API change, consider starting with a\n  [gRFC proposal](https://github.com/grpc/proposal).\n \n- Provide a good **PR description** as a record of **what** change is being made\n  and **why** it was made.  Link to a GitHub issue if it exists.\n \n- Don't fix code style and formatting unless you are already changing that line\n  to address an issue.  PRs with irrelevant changes won't be merged.  If you do\n  want to fix formatting or style, do that in a separate PR.\n\n- If you are adding a new file, make sure it has the copyright message template\n  at the top as a comment. You can copy over the message from an existing file\n  and update the year.\n \n- Unless your PR is trivial, you should expect there will be reviewer comments\n  that you'll need to address before merging.  We expect you to be reasonably\n  responsive to those comments, otherwise the PR will be closed after 2-3 weeks\n  of inactivity.\n\n- If you have non-trivial contributions, please consider adding an entry to [the\n  AUTHORS file](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/AUTHORS) listing the\n  copyright holder for the contribution (yourself, if you are signing the\n  individual CLA, or your company, for corporate CLAs) in the same PR as your\n  contribution.  This needs to be done only once, for each company, or\n  individual. Please keep this file in alphabetical order.\n \n- Maintain **clean commit history** and use **meaningful commit messages**.\n  PRs with messy commit history are difficult to review and won't be merged.\n  Use `rebase -i upstream/master` to curate your commit history and/or to\n  bring in latest changes from master (but avoid rebasing in the middle of\n  a code review).\n \n- Keep your PR up to date with upstream/master (if there are merge conflicts,\n  we can't really merge your change).\n \n- If you are regenerating the projects using\n  `tools/buildgen/generate_projects.sh`, make changes to generated files a\n  separate commit with commit message `regenerate projects`.  Mixing changes\n  to generated and hand-written files make your PR difficult to review.\n  Note that running this script requires the installation of Python packages\n  `pyyaml` and `mako` (typically installed using `pip`) as well as a recent\n  version of [`go`](https://golang.org/doc/install#install).\n \n- **All tests need to be passing** before your change can be merged.\n  We recommend you **run tests locally** before creating your PR to catch\n  breakages early on (see [tools/run_tests](tools/run_tests).  Ultimately, the\n  green signal will be provided by our testing infrastructure.  The reviewer\n  will help you if there are test failures that seem not related to the change\n  you are making.\n \n- Exceptions to the rules can be made if there's a compelling reason for doing\n  so.\n\n## Obtaining Commit Access\nWe grant Commit Access to contributors based on the following criteria:\n* Sustained contribution to the gRPC project.\n* Deep understanding of the areas contributed to, and good consideration of various reliability, usability and performance tradeoffs. \n* Contributions demonstrate that obtaining Commit Access will significantly reduce friction for the contributors or others. \n\nIn addition to submitting PRs, a Contributor with Commit Access can:\n* Review PRs and merge once other checks and criteria pass.\n* Triage bugs and PRs and assign appropriate labels and reviewers. \n\n### Obtaining Commit Access without Code Contributions \nThe [gRPC organization](https://github.com/grpc) is comprised of multiple repositories and commit access is usually restricted to one or more of these repositories. Some repositories such as the [grpc.github.io](https://github.com/grpc/grpc.github.io/) do not have code, but the same principle of sustained, high quality contributions, with a good understanding of the fundamentals, apply. \n\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mongodb/mongo/master/src/third_party/grpc/dist/CONTRIBUTING.md"}, {"result": {"value": "# How to Contribute\n\nThis repository is currently a read-only clone of internal Google code for use\nin open-source projects.

Often, the answer to this question is \"no\".\nWe\u2019d like to articulate our thinking on this issue so that our choices can be\nunderstood by everyone and so that contributors can have a better intuition\nabout whether Abseil might be interested in adopting a new library.\n\n### Priorities\n\nAlthough our mission is to augment the C++ standard library, our goal is not to\nprovide a full forward-compatible implementation of the latest standard. For us\nto consider a library for inclusion in Abseil, it is not enough that a library\nis useful. We generally choose to release a library when it meets at least one\nof the following criteria:\n\n*   **Widespread usage** - Using our internal codebase to help gauge usage, most\n    of the libraries we've released have tens of thousands of users.\n*   **Anticipated widespread usage** - Pre-adoption of some standard-compliant\n    APIs may not have broad adoption initially but can be expected to pick up\n    usage when it replaces legacy APIs. `absl::from_chars`, for example,\n    replaces existing code that converts strings to numbers and will therefore\n    likely see usage growth.\n*   **High impact** - APIs that provide a key solution to a specific problem,\n    such as `absl::FixedArray`, have higher impact than usage numbers may signal\n    and are released because of their importance.\n*   **Direct support for a library that falls under one of the above** - When we\n    want access to a smaller library as an implementation detail for a\n    higher-priority library we plan to release, we may release it, as we did\n    with portions of `absl/meta/type_traits.h`. One consequence of this is that\n    the presence of a library in Abseil does not necessarily mean that other\n    similar libraries would be a high priority.\n\n### API Freeze Consequences\n\nVia the\n[Abseil Compatibility Guidelines](https://abseil.io/about/compatibility), we\nhave promised a large degree of API stability. In particular, we will not make\nbackward-incompatible changes to released APIs without also shipping a tool or\nprocess that can upgrade our users' code. We are not yet at the point of easily\nreleasing such tools. Therefore, at this time, shipping a library establishes an\nAPI contract which is borderline unchangeable. (We can add new functionality,\nbut we cannot easily change existing behavior.) This constraint forces us to\nvery carefully review all APIs that we ship.\n\n\n## Coding Style\n\nTo keep the source consistent, readable, diffable and easy to merge, we use a\nfairly rigid coding style, as defined by the\n[google-styleguide](https://github.com/google/styleguide) project. All patches\nwill be expected to conform to the style outlined\n[here](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).\n\n## Guidelines for Pull Requests\n\n*   If you are a Googler, it is required that you send us a Piper CL instead of\n    using the GitHub pull-request process. The code propagation process will\n    deliver the change to GitHub.\n\n*   Create **small PRs** that are narrowly focused on **addressing a single\n    concern**. We often receive PRs that are trying to fix several things at a\n    time, but if only one fix is considered acceptable, nothing gets merged and\n    both author's & review's time is wasted. Create more PRs to address\n    different concerns and everyone will be happy.\n\n*   For speculative changes, consider opening an [Abseil\n    issue](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/issues) and discussing it first.\n    If you are suggesting a behavioral or API change, consider starting with an\n    [Abseil proposal template](ABSEIL_ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).\n\n*   Provide a good **PR description** as a record of **what** change is being\n    made and **why** it was made. Link to a GitHub issue if it exists.\n\n*   Don't fix code style and formatting unless you are already changing that\n    line to address an issue. Formatting of modified lines may be done using\n   `git clang-format`. PRs with irrelevant changes won't be merged. If\n    you do want to fix formatting or style, do that in a separate PR.\n\n*   Unless your PR is trivial, you should expect there will be reviewer comments\n    that you'll need to address before merging. We expect you to be reasonably\n    responsive to those comments, otherwise the PR will be closed after 2-3\n    weeks of inactivity.\n\n*   Maintain **clean commit history** and use **meaningful commit messages**.\n    PRs with messy commit history are difficult to review and won't be merged.\n    Use `rebase -i upstream/master` to curate your commit history and/or to\n    bring in latest changes from master (but avoid rebasing in the middle of a\n    code review).\n\n*   Keep your PR up to date with upstream/master (if there are merge conflicts,\n    we can't really merge your change).\n\n*   **All tests need to be passing** before your change can be merged. We\n    recommend you **run tests locally** (see below)\n\n*   Exceptions to the rules can be made if there's a compelling reason for doing\n    so. That is - the rules are here to serve us, not the other way around, and\n    the rules need to be serving their intended purpose to be valuable.\n\n*   All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nIf you have [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) installed, use `bazel test\n--test_tag_filters=\"-benchmark\" ...` to run the unit tests.\n\nIf you are running the Linux operating system and have\n[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed, you can also run the `linux_*.sh`\nscripts under the `ci/`(https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/tree/master/ci)\ndirectory to test Abseil under a variety of conditions.\n\n## Abseil Committers\n\nThe current members of the Abseil engineering team are the only committers at\npresent.\n\n## Release Process\n\nAbseil lives at head, where latest-and-greatest code can be found.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mongodb/mongo/master/src/third_party/abseil-cpp/dist/CONTRIBUTING.md"}, {"result": {"value": "# How to Contribute\n\nWe'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project.

Typically, zstd\nwill use a new branch per sizable topic. For smaller changes, it is okay to lump multiple\nrelated changes into a branch.\n\nOur contribution process works in three main stages:\n1. Local development\n    * Update:\n        * Checkout your fork of zstd if you have not already\n        ```\n        git checkout https://github.com/<username>/zstd\n        cd zstd\n        ```\n        * Update your local dev branch\n        ```\n        git pull https://github.com/facebook/zstd dev\n        git push origin dev\n        ```\n    * Topic and development:\n        * Make a new branch on your fork about the topic you're developing for\n        ```\n        # branch names should be concise but sufficiently informative\n        git checkout -b <branch-name>\n        git push origin <branch-name>\n        ```\n        * Make commits and push\n        ```\n        # make some changes =\n        git add -u && git commit -m <message>\n        git push origin <branch-name>\n        ```\n        * Note: run local tests to ensure that your changes didn't break existing functionality\n            * Quick check\n            ```\n            make shortest\n            ```\n            * Longer check\n            ```\n            make test\n            ```\n2. Code Review and CI tests\n    * Ensure CI tests pass:\n        * Before sharing anything to the community, create a pull request in your own fork against the dev branch\n        and make sure that all GitHub Actions CI tests pass. See the Continuous Integration section below for more information.\n        * Ensure that static analysis passes on your development machine. See the Static Analysis section\n        below to see how to do this.\n    * Create a pull request:\n        * When you are ready to share you changes to the community, create a pull request from your branch\n        to facebook:dev. You can do this very easily by clicking 'Create Pull Request' on your fork's home\n        page.\n        * From there, select the branch where you made changes as your source branch and facebook:dev\n        as the destination.\n        * Examine the diff presented between the two branches to make sure there is nothing unexpected.\n    * Write a good pull request description:\n        * While there is no strict template that our contributors follow, we would like them to\n        sufficiently summarize and motivate the changes they are proposing. We recommend all pull requests,\n        at least indirectly, address the following points.\n            * Is this pull request important and why?\n            * Is it addressing an issue? If so, what issue? (provide links for convenience please)\n            * Is this a new feature? If so, why is it useful and/or necessary?\n            * Are there background references and documents that reviewers should be aware of to properly assess this change?\n        * Note: make sure to point out any design and architectural decisions that you made and the rationale behind them.\n        * Note: if you have been working with a specific user and would like them to review your work, make sure you mention them using (@<username>)\n    * Submit the pull request and iterate with feedback.\n3. Merge and Release\n    * Getting approval:\n        * You will have to iterate on your changes with feedback from other collaborators to reach a point\n        where your pull request can be safely merged.\n        * To avoid too many comments on style and convention, make sure that you have a\n        look at our style section below before creating a pull request.\n        * Eventually, someone from the zstd team will approve your pull request and not long after merge it into\n        the dev branch.\n    * Housekeeping:\n        * Most PRs are linked with one or more Github issues. If this is the case for your PR, make sure\n        the corresponding issue is mentioned. If your change 'fixes' or completely addresses the\n        issue at hand, then please indicate this by requesting that an issue be closed by commenting.\n        * Just because your changes have been merged does not mean the topic or larger issue is complete. Remember\n        that the change must make it to an official zstd release for it to be meaningful. We recommend\n        that contributors track the activity on their pull request and corresponding issue(s) page(s) until\n        their change makes it to the next release of zstd. Users will often discover bugs in your code or\n        suggest ways to refine and improve your initial changes even after the pull request is merged.\n\n## Static Analysis\nStatic analysis is a process for examining the correctness or validity of a program without actually\nexecuting it. It usually helps us find many simple bugs. Zstd uses clang's `scan-build` tool for\nstatic analysis. You can install it by following the instructions for your OS on https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/scan-build.\n\nOnce installed, you can ensure that our static analysis tests pass on your local development machine\nby running:\n```\nmake staticAnalyze\n```\n\nIn general, you can use `scan-build` to static analyze any build script. For example, to static analyze\njust `contrib/largeNbDicts` and nothing else, you can run:\n\n```\nscan-build make -C contrib/largeNbDicts largeNbDicts\n```\n\n### Pitfalls of static analysis\n`scan-build` is part of our regular CI suite. Other static analyzers are not.\n\nIt can be useful to look at additional static analyzers once in a while (and we do), but it's not a good idea to multiply the nb of analyzers run continuously at each commit and PR. The reasons are :\n\n- Static analyzers are full of false positive. The signal to noise ratio is actually pretty low.\n- A good CI policy is \"zero-warning tolerance\". That means that all issues must be solved, including false positives. This quickly becomes a tedious workload.\n- Multiple static analyzers will feature multiple kind of false positives, sometimes applying to the same code but in different ways leading to :\n   + tortuous code, trying to please multiple constraints, hurting readability and therefore maintenance. Sometimes, such complexity introduce other more subtle bugs, that are just out of scope of the analyzers.\n   + sometimes, these constraints are mutually exclusive : if one try to solve one, the other static analyzer will complain, they can't be both happy at the same time.\n- As if that was not enough, the list of false positives change with each version. It's hard enough to follow one static analyzer, but multiple ones with their own update agenda, this quickly becomes a massive velocity reducer.\n\nThis is different from running a static analyzer once in a while, looking at the output, and __cherry picking__ a few warnings that seem helpful, either because they detected a genuine risk of bug, or because it helps expressing the code in a way which is more readable or more difficult to misuse. These kinds of reports can be useful, and are accepted.\n\n## Continuous Integration\nCI tests run every time a pull request (PR) is created or updated. The exact tests\nthat get run will depend on the destination branch you specify. Some tests take\nlonger to run than others. Currently, our CI is set up to run a short\nseries of tests when creating a PR to the dev branch and a longer series of tests\nwhen creating a PR to the release branch. You can look in the configuration files\nof the respective CI platform for more information on what gets run when.\n\nMost people will just want to create a PR with the destination set to their local dev\nbranch of zstd. You can then find the status of the tests on the PR's page. You can also\nre-run tests and cancel running tests from the PR page or from the respective CI's dashboard.\n\nAlmost all of zstd's CI runs on GitHub Actions (configured at `.github/workflows`), which will automatically run on PRs to your\nown fork. A small number of tests run on other services (e.g. Travis CI, Circle CI, Appveyor).\nThese require work to set up on your local fork, and (at least for Travis CI) cost money.\nTherefore, if the PR on your local fork passes GitHub Actions, feel free to submit a PR\nagainst the main repo.\n\n### Third-party CI\nA small number of tests cannot run on GitHub Actions, or have yet to be migrated.\nFor these, we use a variety of third-party services (listed below). It is not necessary to set\nthese up on your fork in order to contribute to zstd; however, we do link to instructions for those\nwho want earlier signal.\n\n| Service   | Purpose                                                                                                    | Setup Links                                                                                                                                            | Config Path            |\n|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Travis CI | Used for testing on non-x86 architectures such as PowerPC                                                  | https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorial/#to-get-started-with-travis-ci-using-github <br> https://github.com/marketplace/travis-ci                     | `.travis.yml`          |\n| AppVeyor  | Used for some Windows testing (e.g. cygwin, mingw)                                                         | https://www.appveyor.com/blog/2018/10/02/github-apps-integration/ <br> https://github.com/marketplace/appveyor                                         | `appveyor.yml`         |\n| Cirrus CI | Used for testing on FreeBSD                                                                                | https://github.com/marketplace/cirrus-ci/                                                                                                              | `.cirrus.yml`          |\n| Circle CI | Historically was used to provide faster signal,<br/> but we may be able to migrate these to Github Actions | https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/getting-started/#setting-up-circleci <br> https://youtu.be/Js3hMUsSZ2c <br> https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/enable-checks/ | `.circleci/config.yml` |\n\nNote: the instructions linked above mostly cover how to set up a repository with CI from scratch. \nThe general idea should be the same for setting up CI on your fork of zstd, but you may have to \nfollow slightly different steps. In particular, please ignore any instructions related to setting up\nconfig files (since zstd already has configs for each of these services).\n\n## Performance\nPerformance is extremely important for zstd and we only merge pull requests whose performance\nlandscape and corresponding trade-offs have been adequately analyzed, reproduced, and presented.\nThis high bar for performance means that every PR which has the potential to\nimpact performance takes a very long time for us to properly review. That being said, we\nalways welcome contributions to improve performance (or worsen performance for the trade-off of\nsomething else). Please keep the following in mind before submitting a performance related PR:\n\n1. Zstd isn't as old as gzip but it has been around for time now and its evolution is\nvery well documented via past Github issues and pull requests. It may be the case that your\nparticular performance optimization has already been considered in the past. Please take some\ntime to search through old issues and pull requests using keywords specific to your\nwould-be PR. Of course, just because a topic has already been discussed (and perhaps rejected\non some grounds) in the past, doesn't mean it isn't worth bringing up again. But even in that case,\nit will be helpful for you to have context from that topic's history before contributing.\n2. The distinction between noise and actual performance gains can unfortunately be very subtle\nespecially when microbenchmarking extremely small wins or losses. The only remedy to getting\nsomething subtle merged is extensive benchmarking. You will be doing us a great favor if you\ntake the time to run extensive, long-duration, and potentially cross-(os, platform, process, etc)\nbenchmarks on your end before submitting a PR. Of course, you will not be able to benchmark\nyour changes on every single processor and os out there (and neither will we) but do that best\nyou can:) We've added some things to think about when benchmarking below in the Benchmarking\nPerformance section which might be helpful for you.\n3. Optimizing performance for a certain OS, processor vendor, compiler, or network system is a perfectly\nlegitimate thing to do as long as it does not harm the overall performance health of Zstd.\nThis is a hard balance to strike but please keep in mind other aspects of Zstd when\nsubmitting changes that are clang-specific, windows-specific, etc.\n\n## Benchmarking Performance\nPerformance microbenchmarking is a tricky subject but also essential for Zstd. We value empirical\ntesting over theoretical speculation. This guide it not perfect but for most scenarios, it\nis a good place to start.\n\n### Stability\nUnfortunately, the most important aspect in being able to benchmark reliably is to have a stable\nbenchmarking machine. A virtual machine, a machine with shared resources, or your laptop\nwill typically not be stable enough to obtain reliable benchmark results. If you can get your\nhands on a desktop, this is usually a better scenario.\n\nOf course, benchmarking can be done on non-hyper-stable machines as well. You will just have to\ndo a little more work to ensure that you are in fact measuring the changes you've made not and\nnoise. Here are some things you can do to make your benchmarks more stable:\n\n1. The most simple thing you can do to drastically improve the stability of your benchmark is\nto run it multiple times and then aggregate the results of those runs. As a general rule of\nthumb, the smaller the change you are trying to measure, the more samples of benchmark runs\nyou will have to aggregate over to get reliable results. Here are some additional things to keep in\nmind when running multiple trials:\n    * How you aggregate your samples are important. You might be tempted to use the mean of your\n    results. While this is certainly going to be a more stable number than a raw single sample\n    benchmark number, you might have more luck by taking the median. The mean is not robust to\n    outliers whereas the median is. Better still, you could simply take the fastest speed your\n    benchmark achieved on each run since that is likely the fastest your process will be\n    capable of running your code. In our experience, this (aggregating by just taking the sample\n    with the fastest running time) has been the most stable approach.\n    * The more samples you have, the more stable your benchmarks should be. You can verify\n    your improved stability by looking at the size of your confidence intervals as you\n    increase your sample count. These should get smaller and smaller. Eventually hopefully\n    smaller than the performance win you are expecting.\n    * Most processors will take some time to get `hot` when running anything. The observations\n    you collect during that time period will very different from the true performance number. Having\n    a very large number of sample will help alleviate this problem slightly but you can also\n    address is directly by simply not including the first `n` iterations of your benchmark in\n    your aggregations. You can determine `n` by simply looking at the results from each iteration\n    and then hand picking a good threshold after which the variance in results seems to stabilize.\n2. You cannot really get reliable benchmarks if your host machine is simultaneously running\nanother cpu/memory-intensive application in the background. If you are running benchmarks on your\npersonal laptop for instance, you should close all applications (including your code editor and\nbrowser) before running your benchmarks. You might also have invisible background applications\nrunning. You can see what these are by looking at either Activity Monitor on Mac or Task Manager\non Windows. You will get more stable benchmark results of you end those processes as well.\n    * If you have multiple cores, you can even run your benchmark on a reserved core to prevent\n    pollution from other OS and user processes. There are a number of ways to do this depending\n    on your OS:\n        * On linux boxes, you have use https://github.com/lpechacek/cpuset.\n        * On Windows, you can \"Set Processor Affinity\" using https://www.thewindowsclub.com/processor-affinity-windows\n        * On Mac, you can try to use their dedicated affinity API https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/releasenotes/Performance/RN-AffinityAPI/#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006635-CH1-DontLinkElementID_2\n3. To benchmark, you will likely end up writing a separate c/c++ program that will link libzstd.\nDynamically linking your library will introduce some added variation (not a large amount but\ndefinitely some). Statically linking libzstd will be more stable. Static libraries should\nbe enabled by default when building zstd.\n4. Use a profiler with a good high resolution timer. See the section below on profiling for\ndetails on this.\n5. Disable frequency scaling, turbo boost and address space randomization (this will vary by OS)\n6. Try to avoid storage. On some systems you can use tmpfs. Putting the program, inputs and outputs on\ntmpfs avoids touching a real storage system, which can have a pretty big variability.\n\nAlso check our LLVM's guide on benchmarking here: https://llvm.org/docs/Benchmarking.html\n\n### Zstd benchmark\nThe fastest signal you can get regarding your performance changes is via the in-build zstd cli\nbench option. You can run Zstd as you typically would for your scenario using some set of options\nand then additionally also specify the `-b#` option. Doing this will run our benchmarking pipeline\nfor that options you have just provided. If you want to look at the internals of how this\nbenchmarking script works, you can check out programs/benchzstd.c\n\nFor example: say you have made a change that you believe improves the speed of zstd level 1. The\nvery first thing you should use to assess whether you actually achieved any sort of improvement\nis `zstd -b`. You might try to do something like this. Note: you can use the `-i` option to\nspecify a running time for your benchmark in seconds (default is 3 seconds).\nUsually, the longer the running time, the more stable your results will be.\n\n```\n$ git checkout <commit-before-your-change>\n$ make && cp zstd zstd-old\n$ git checkout <commit-after-your-change>\n$ make && cp zstd zstd-new\n$ zstd-old -i5 -b1 <your-test-data>\n 1<your-test-data>         :      8990 ->      3992 (2.252), 302.6 MB/s , 626.4 MB/s\n$ zstd-new -i5 -b1 <your-test-data>\n 1<your-test-data>         :      8990 ->      3992 (2.252), 302.8 MB/s , 628.4 MB/s\n```\n\nUnless your performance win is large enough to be visible despite the intrinsic noise\non your computer, benchzstd alone will likely not be enough to validate the impact of your\nchanges. For example, the results of the example above indicate that effectively nothing\nchanged but there could be a small <3% improvement that the noise on the host machine\nobscured. So unless you see a large performance win (10-15% consistently) using just\nthis method of evaluation will not be sufficient.\n\n### Profiling\nThere are a number of great profilers out there. We're going to briefly mention how you can\nprofile your code using `instruments` on mac, `perf` on linux and `visual studio profiler`\non Windows.\n\nSay you have an idea for a change that you think will provide some good performance gains\nfor level 1 compression on Zstd. Typically this means, you have identified a section of\ncode that you think can be made to run faster.\n\nThe first thing you will want to do is make sure that the piece of code is actually taking up\na notable amount of time to run. It is usually not worth optimizing something which accounts for less than\n0.0001% of the total running time. Luckily, there are tools to help with this.\nProfilers will let you see how much time your code spends inside a particular function.\nIf your target code snippet is only part of a function, it might be worth trying to\nisolate that snippet by moving it to its own function (this is usually not necessary but\nmight be).\n\nMost profilers (including the profilers discussed below) will generate a call graph of\nfunctions for you. Your goal will be to find your function of interest in this call graph\nand then inspect the time spent inside of it. You might also want to look at the annotated\nassembly which most profilers will provide you with.\n\n#### Instruments\nWe will once again consider the scenario where you think you've identified a piece of code\nwhose performance can be improved upon. Follow these steps to profile your code using\nInstruments.\n\n1. Open Instruments\n2. Select `Time Profiler` from the list of standard templates\n3. Close all other applications except for your instruments window and your terminal\n4. Run your benchmarking script from your terminal window\n    * You will want a benchmark that runs for at least a few seconds (5 seconds will\n    usually be long enough). This way the profiler will have something to work with\n    and you will have ample time to attach your profiler to this process:)\n    * I will just use benchzstd as my benchmarmking script for this example:\n```\n$ zstd -b1 -i5 <my-data> # this will run for 5 seconds\n```\n5. Once you run your benchmarking script, switch back over to instruments and attach your\nprocess to the time profiler. You can do this by:\n    * Clicking on the `All Processes` drop down in the top left of the toolbar.\n    * Selecting your process from the dropdown. In my case, it is just going to be labeled\n    `zstd`\n    * Hitting the bright red record circle button on the top left of the toolbar\n6. You profiler will now start collecting metrics from your benchmarking script. Once\nyou think you have collected enough samples (usually this is the case after 3 seconds of\nrecording), stop your profiler.\n7. Make sure that in toolbar of the bottom window, `profile` is selected.\n8. You should be able to see your call graph.\n    * If you don't see the call graph or an incomplete call graph, make sure you have compiled\n    zstd and your benchmarking script using debug flags. On mac and linux, this just means\n    you will have to supply the `-g` flag alone with your build script. You might also\n    have to provide the `-fno-omit-frame-pointer` flag\n9. Dig down the graph to find your function call and then inspect it by double clicking\nthe list item. You will be able to see the annotated source code and the assembly side by\nside.\n\n#### Perf\n\nThis wiki has a pretty detailed tutorial on getting started working with perf so we'll\nleave you to check that out of you're getting started:\n\nhttps://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Tutorial\n\nSome general notes on perf:\n* Use `perf stat -r # <bench-program>` to quickly get some relevant timing and\ncounter statistics. Perf uses a high resolution timer and this is likely one\nof the first things your team will run when assessing your PR.\n* Perf has a long list of hardware counters that can be viewed with `perf --list`.\nWhen measuring optimizations, something worth trying is to make sure the hardware\ncounters you expect to be impacted by your change are in fact being so. For example,\nif you expect the L1 cache misses to decrease with your change, you can look at the\ncounter `L1-dcache-load-misses`\n* Perf hardware counters will not work on a virtual machine.\n\n#### Visual Studio\n\nTODO\n\n## Issues\nWe use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is\nclear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.\n\nFacebook has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe\ndisclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process\noutlined on that page and do not file a public issue.\n\n## Coding Style\nIt's a pretty long topic, which is difficult to summarize in a single paragraph.\nAs a rule of thumbs, try to imitate the coding style of\nsimilar lines of codes around your contribution.\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of rules employed in zstd code base:\n\n### C90\nThis code base is following strict C90 standard,\nwith 2 extensions : 64-bit `long long` types, and variadic macros.\nThis rule is applied strictly to code within `lib/` and `programs/`.\nSub-project in `contrib/` are allowed to use other conventions.\n\n### C++ direct compatibility : symbol mangling\nAll public symbol declarations must be wrapped in `extern \u201cC\u201d { \u2026 }`,\nso that this project can be compiled as C++98 code,\nand linked into C++ applications.\n\n### Minimal Frugal\nThis design requirement is fundamental to preserve the portability of the code base.\n#### Dependencies\n- Reduce dependencies to the minimum possible level.\n  Any dependency should be considered \u201cbad\u201d by default,\n  and only tolerated because it provides a service in a better way than can be achieved locally.\n  The only external dependencies this repository tolerates are\n  standard C libraries, and in rare cases, system level headers.\n- Within `lib/`, this policy is even more drastic.\n  The only external dependencies allowed are `<assert.h>`, `<stdlib.h>`, `<string.h>`,\n  and even then, not directly.\n  In particular, no function shall ever allocate on heap directly,\n  and must use instead `ZSTD_malloc()` and equivalent.\n  Other accepted non-symbol headers are `<stddef.h>` and `<limits.h>`.\n- Within the project, there is a strict hierarchy of dependencies that must be respected.\n  `programs/` is allowed to depend on `lib/`, but only its public API.\n  Within `lib/`, `lib/common` doesn't depend on any other directory.\n  `lib/compress` and `lib/decompress` shall not depend on each other.\n  `lib/dictBuilder` can depend on `lib/common` and `lib/compress`, but not `lib/decompress`.\n#### Resources\n- Functions in `lib/` must use very little stack space,\n  several dozens of bytes max.\n  Everything larger must use the heap allocator,\n  or require a scratch buffer to be emplaced manually.\n\n### Naming\n* All public symbols are prefixed with `ZSTD_`\n  + private symbols, with a scope limited to their own unit, are free of this restriction.\n    However, since `libzstd` source code can be amalgamated,\n    each symbol name must attempt to be (and remain) unique.\n    Avoid too generic names that could become ground for future collisions.\n    This generally implies usage of some form of prefix.\n* For symbols (functions and variables), naming convention is `PREFIX_camelCase`.\n  + In some advanced cases, one can also find :\n    - `PREFIX_prefix2_camelCase`\n    - `PREFIX_camelCase_extendedQualifier`\n* Multi-words names generally consist of an action followed by object:\n  - for example : `ZSTD_createCCtx()`\n* Prefer positive actions\n  - `goBackward` rather than `notGoForward`\n* Type names (`struct`, etc.) follow similar convention,\n  except that they are allowed and even invited to start by an Uppercase letter.\n  Example : `ZSTD_CCtx`, `ZSTD_CDict`\n* Macro names are all Capital letters.\n  The same composition rules (`PREFIX_NAME_QUALIFIER`) apply.\n* File names are all lowercase letters.\n  The convention is `snake_case`.\n  File names **must** be unique across the entire code base,\n  even when they stand in clearly separated directories.\n\n### Qualifiers\n* This code base is `const` friendly, if not `const` fanatical.\n  Any variable that can be `const` (aka. read-only) **must** be `const`.\n  Any pointer which content will not be modified must be `const`.\n  This property is then controlled at compiler level.\n  `const` variables are an important signal to readers that this variable isn't modified.\n  Conversely, non-const variables are a signal to readers to watch out for modifications later on in the function.\n* If a function must be inlined, mention it explicitly,\n  using project's own portable macros, such as `FORCE_INLINE_ATTR`,\n  defined in `lib/common/compiler.h`.\n\n### Debugging\n* **Assertions** are welcome, and should be used very liberally,\n  to control any condition the code expects for its correct execution.\n  These assertion checks will be run in debug builds, and disabled in production.\n* For traces, this project provides its own debug macros,\n  in particular `DEBUGLOG(level, ...)`, defined in `lib/common/debug.h`.\n\n### Code documentation\n* Avoid code documentation that merely repeats what the code is already stating.\n  Whenever applicable, prefer employing the code as the primary way to convey explanations.\n  Example 1 : `int nbTokens = n;` instead of `int i = n; /* i is a nb of tokens *./`.\n  Example 2 : `assert(size > 0);` instead of `/* here, size should be positive */`.\n* At declaration level, the documentation explains how to use the function or variable\n  and when applicable why it's needed, of the scenarios where it can be useful.\n* At implementation level, the documentation explains the general outline of the algorithm employed,\n  and when applicable why this specific choice was preferred.\n\n### General layout\n* 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs\n* Code documentation shall directly precede function declaration or implementation\n* Function implementations and its code documentation should be preceded and followed by an empty line\n\n\n## License\nBy contributing to Zstandard, you agree that your contributions will be licensed\nunder both the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file and the [COPYING](COPYING) file in the root directory of this source tree.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mongodb/mongo/master/src/third_party/zstandard/zstd/CONTRIBUTING.md"}, {"result": {"value": "# Contributing to Protocol Buffers\n\nWe welcome some types of contributions to protocol buffers. This doc describes the\nprocess to contribute patches to protobuf and the general guidelines we\nexpect contributors to follow.\n\n## What We Accept\n\n* Bug fixes with unit tests demonstrating the problem are very welcome.\n  We also appreciate bug reports, even when they don't come with a patch.\n  Bug fixes without tests are usually not accepted.\n* New APIs and features with adequate test coverage and documentation\n  may be accepted if they do not compromise backwards \n  compatibility. However there's a fairly high bar of usefulness a new public\n  method must clear before it will be accepted. Features that are fine in \n  isolation are often rejected because they don't have enough impact to justify the \n  conceptual burden and ongoing maintenance cost. It's best to file an issue \n  and get agreement from maintainers on the value of a new feature before\n  working on a PR.\n* Performance optimizations may be accepted if they have convincing benchmarks that demonstrate \n  an improvement and they do not significantly increase complexity.  \n* Changes to existing APIs are almost never accepted. Stability and\n  backwards compatibility are paramount. In the unlikely event a breaking change \n  is required, it must usually be implemented in google3 first. \n* Changes to the wire and text formats are never accepted. Any breaking change\n  to these formats would have to be implemented as a completely new format.\n  We cannot begin generating protos that cannot be parsed by existing code.\n\n## Before You Start\n\nWe accept patches in the form of github pull requests. If you are new to\ngithub, please read [How to create github pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)\nfirst.\n\n### Contributor License Agreements\n\nContributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License\nAgreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution,\nthis simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions\nas part of the project.\n\n* If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you\n  own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual?csw=1).\n* If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,\n  then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-corporate?csw=1).\n\n### Coding Style\n\nThis project follows [Google\u2019s Coding Style Guides](https://github.com/google/styleguide).\nBefore sending out your pull request, please familiarize yourself with the\ncorresponding style guides and make sure the proposed code change is style\nconforming.\n\n## Contributing Process\n\nMost pull requests should go to the main branch and the change will be\nincluded in the next major/minor version release (e.g., 3.6.0 release). If you\nneed to include a bug fix in a patch release (e.g., 3.5.2), make sure it\u2019s\nalready merged to main, and then create a pull request cherry-picking the\ncommits from main branch to the release branch (e.g., branch 3.5.x).\n\nFor each pull request, a protobuf team member will be assigned to review the\npull request. For minor cleanups, the pull request may be merged right away\nafter an initial review. For larger changes, you will likely receive multiple\nrounds of comments and it may take some time to complete. We will try to keep\nour response time within 7-days but if you don\u2019t get any response in a few\ndays, feel free to comment on the threads to get our attention. We also expect\nyou to respond to our comments within a reasonable amount of time. If we don\u2019t\nhear from you for 2 weeks or longer, we may close the pull request. You can\nstill send the pull request again once you have time to work on it.\n\nOnce a pull request is merged, we will take care of the rest and get it into\nthe final release.\n\n## Pull Request Guidelines\n\n* If you are a Googler, it is preferable to first create an internal CL and\n  have it reviewed and submitted. The code propagation process will deliver the\n  change to GitHub.\n* Create small PRs that are narrowly focused on addressing a single concern.\n  We often receive PRs that are trying to fix several things at a time, but if\n  only one fix is considered acceptable, nothing gets merged and both author's\n  & reviewer's time is wasted. Create more PRs to address different concerns and\n  everyone will be happy.\n* For speculative changes, consider opening an issue and discussing it first.\n  If you are suggesting a behavioral or API change, make sure you get explicit\n  support from a protobuf team member before sending us the pull request.\n* Provide a good PR description as a record of what change is being made and\n  why it was made. Link to a GitHub issue if it exists.\n* Don't fix code style and formatting unless you are already changing that\n  line to address an issue. PRs with irrelevant changes won't be merged. If\n  you do want to fix formatting or style, do that in a separate PR.\n* Unless your PR is trivial, you should expect there will be reviewer comments\n  that you'll need to address before merging. We expect you to be reasonably\n  responsive to those comments, otherwise the PR will be closed after 2-3 weeks\n  of inactivity.\n* Maintain clean commit history and use meaningful commit messages. PRs with\n  messy commit history are difficult to review and won't be merged. Use rebase\n  -i upstream/main to curate your commit history and/or to bring in latest\n  changes from main (but avoid rebasing in the middle of a code review).\n* Keep your PR up to date with upstream/main (if there are merge conflicts,\n  we can't really merge your change).\n* All tests need to be passing before your change can be merged. We recommend\n  you run tests locally before creating your PR to catch breakages early on.\n  Ultimately, the green signal will be provided by our testing infrastructure.\n  The reviewer will help you if there are test failures that seem not related\n  to the change you are making.\n\n## Reviewer Guidelines\n\n* Make sure that all tests are passing before approval.\n* Apply the \"release notes: yes\" label if the pull request's description should\n  be included in the next release (e.g., any new feature / bug fix).\n  Apply the \"release notes: no\" label if the pull request's description should\n  not be included in the next release (e.g., refactoring changes that does not\n  change behavior, integration from Google internal, updating tests, etc.).\n* Apply the appropriate language label (e.g., C++, Java, Python, etc.) to the\n  pull request. This will make it easier to identify which languages the pull\n  request affects, allowing us to better identify appropriate reviewer, create\n  a better release note, and make it easier to identify issues in the future.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mongodb/mongo/master/src/third_party/protobuf/dist/CONTRIBUTING.md"}, {"result": {"value": "# How to Contribute\n\nThis repository is currently a read-only clone of internal Google code for use\nin open-source projects.

This document\ndoes not describe how to install c-ares using such a binary package.\nThis document describes how to compile, build and install c-ares from\nsource code.\n\nBuilding from Git\n=================\n\nIf you get your code off a Git repository rather than an official\nrelease tarball, see the [GIT-INFO](GIT-INFO) file in the root directory\nfor specific instructions on how to proceed.\n\nIn particular, if not using CMake you will need to run `./buildconf` (Unix) or\n`buildconf.bat` (Windows) to generate build files, and for the former\nyou will need a local installation of Autotools.  If using CMake the steps are\nthe same for both Git and official release tarballs.\n\nAutoTools Build\n===============\n\n### General Information, works on most Unix Platforms (Linux, FreeBSD, etc)\n\nA normal Unix installation is made in three or four steps (after you've\nunpacked the source archive):\n\n    ./configure\n    make\n    make install\n\nYou probably need to be root when doing the last command.\n\nIf you have checked out the sources from the git repository, read the\n[GIT-INFO](GIT_INFO) on how to proceed.\n\nGet a full listing of all available configure options by invoking it like:\n\n    ./configure --help\n\nIf you want to install c-ares in a different file hierarchy than /usr/local,\nyou need to specify that already when running configure:\n\n    ./configure --prefix=/path/to/c-ares/tree\n\nIf you happen to have write permission in that directory, you can do `make\ninstall` without being root. An example of this would be to make a local\ninstall in your own home directory:\n\n    ./configure --prefix=$HOME\n    make\n    make install\n\n### More Options\n\nTo force configure to use the standard cc compiler if both cc and gcc are\npresent, run configure like\n\n    CC=cc ./configure\n    # or\n    env CC=cc ./configure\n\nTo force a static library compile, disable the shared library creation\nby running configure like:\n\n    ./configure --disable-shared\n\nIf you're a c-ares developer and use gcc, you might want to enable more\ndebug options with the `--enable-debug` option.\n\n### Special Cases\n\nSome versions of uClibc require configuring with `CPPFLAGS=-D_GNU_SOURCE=1`\nto get correct large file support.\n\nThe Open Watcom C compiler on Linux requires configuring with the variables:\n\n    ./configure CC=owcc AR=\"$WATCOM/binl/wlib\" AR_FLAGS=-q \\\n        RANLIB=/bin/true STRIP=\"$WATCOM/binl/wstrip\" CFLAGS=-Wextra\n\n\n### CROSS COMPILE\n\n(This section was graciously brought to us by Jim Duey, with additions by\nDan Fandrich)\n\nDownload and unpack the c-ares package.\n\n`cd` to the new directory. (e.g. `cd c-ares-1.7.6`)\n\nSet environment variables to point to the cross-compile toolchain and call\nconfigure with any options you need.  Be sure and specify the `--host` and\n`--build` parameters at configuration time.  The following script is an\nexample of cross-compiling for the IBM 405GP PowerPC processor using the\ntoolchain from MonteVista for Hardhat Linux.\n\n```sh\n#! /bin/sh\n\nexport PATH=$PATH:/opt/hardhat/devkit/ppc/405/bin\nexport CPPFLAGS=\"-I/opt/hardhat/devkit/ppc/405/target/usr/include\"\nexport AR=ppc_405-ar\nexport AS=ppc_405-as\nexport LD=ppc_405-ld\nexport RANLIB=ppc_405-ranlib\nexport CC=ppc_405-gcc\nexport NM=ppc_405-nm\n\n./configure --target=powerpc-hardhat-linux \\\n     --host=powerpc-hardhat-linux \\\n     --build=i586-pc-linux-gnu \\\n     --prefix=/opt/hardhat/devkit/ppc/405/target/usr/local \\\n     --exec-prefix=/usr/local\n```\n\nYou may also need to provide a parameter like `--with-random=/dev/urandom`\nto configure as it cannot detect the presence of a random number\ngenerating device for a target system.  The `--prefix` parameter\nspecifies where c-ares will be installed.  If `configure` completes\nsuccessfully, do `make` and `make install` as usual.\n\nIn some cases, you may be able to simplify the above commands to as\nlittle as:\n\n    ./configure --host=ARCH-OS\n\n\n### Cygwin (Windows)\n\nAlmost identical to the unix installation. Run the configure script in the\nc-ares root with `sh configure`. Make sure you have the sh executable in\n`/bin/` or you'll see the configure fail toward the end.\n\nRun `make`\n\n\n### QNX\n\n(This section was graciously brought to us by David Bentham)\n\nAs QNX is targeted for resource constrained environments, the QNX headers\nset conservative limits. This includes the `FD_SETSIZE` macro, set by default\nto 32. Socket descriptors returned within the c-ares library may exceed this,\nresulting in memory faults/SIGSEGV crashes when passed into `select(..)`\ncalls using `fd_set` macros.\n\nA good all-round solution to this is to override the default when building\nc-ares, by overriding `CFLAGS` during configure, example:\n\n    # configure CFLAGS='-DFD_SETSIZE=64 -g -O2'\n\n\n### RISC OS\n\nThe library can be cross-compiled using gccsdk as follows:\n\n    CC=riscos-gcc AR=riscos-ar RANLIB='riscos-ar -s' ./configure \\\n         --host=arm-riscos-aof --without-random --disable-shared\n    make\n\nwhere `riscos-gcc` and `riscos-ar` are links to the gccsdk tools.\nYou can then link your program with `c-ares/lib/.libs/libcares.a`.\n\n\n### Android\n\nMethod using a configure cross-compile (tested with Android NDK r7b):\n\n  - prepare the toolchain of the Android NDK for standalone use; this can\n    be done by invoking the script:\n\n        ./tools/make-standalone-toolchain.sh\n\n    which creates a usual cross-compile toolchain. Lets assume that you put\n    this toolchain below `/opt` then invoke configure with something\n    like:\n\n    ```\n        export PATH=/opt/arm-linux-androideabi-4.4.3/bin:$PATH\n       ./configure --host=arm-linux-androideabi [more configure options]\n        make\n    ```\n  - if you want to compile directly from our GIT repo you might run into\n    this issue with older automake stuff:\n\n    ```\n        checking host system type...\n        Invalid configuration `arm-linux-androideabi':\n        system `androideabi' not recognized\n        configure: error: /bin/sh ./config.sub arm-linux-androideabi failed\n    ```\n    this issue can be fixed with using more recent versions of `config.sub`\n    and `config.guess` which can be obtained here:\n    http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=config.git;a=tree\n    you need to replace your system-own versions which usually can be\n    found in your automake folder:\n    `find /usr -name config.sub`\n\n\nCMake builds\n============\n\nCurrent releases of c-ares introduce a CMake v3+ build system that has been\ntested on most platforms including Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, MacOS, AIX and\nSolaris.\n\nIn the most basic form, building with CMake might look like:\n\n```sh\ncd /path/to/cmake/source\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/cares ..\nmake\nsudo make install\n```\n\nOptions\n-------\n\nOptions to CMake are passed on the command line using \"-D${OPTION}=${VALUE}\".\nThe values defined are all boolean and take values like On, Off, True, False.\n\n* CARES_STATIC - Build the static library (off by default)\n* CARES_SHARED - Build the shared library (on by default)\n* CARES_INSTALL - Hook in installation, useful to disable if chain building\n* CARES_STATIC_PIC - Build the static library as position-independent (off by\n   default)\n\n\nNinja\n-----\n\nNinja is the next-generation build system meant for generators like CMake that\nheavily parallize builds.  Its use is very similar to the normal build:\n\n```sh\ncd /path/to/cmake/source\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/cares -G \"Ninja\" ..\nninja\nsudo ninja install\n```\n\nWindows MSVC Command Line\n-------------------------\n\n```\ncd \\path\\to\\cmake\\source\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\\cares -G \"NMake Makefiles\" ..\nnmake\nnmake install\n```\n\nWindows MinGW-w64 Command Line via MSYS\n---------------------------------------\n```\ncd \\path\\to\\cmake\\source\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\\cares -G \"MSYS Makefiles\" ..\nmake\nmake install\n```\n\n\nPlatform-specific build systems\n===============================\n\nWin32\n-----\n\n### Building Windows DLLs and C run-time (CRT) linkage issues\n\nAs a general rule, building a DLL with static CRT linkage is highly\ndiscouraged, and intermixing CRTs in the same app is something to\navoid at any cost.\n\nReading and comprehension of Microsoft Knowledge Base articles\nKB94248 and KB140584 is a must for any Windows developer. Especially\nimportant is full understanding if you are not going to follow the\nadvice given above.\n\n - [KB94248](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/94248/en-us) - How To Use the C Run-Time\n\n - [KB140584](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/140584/en-us) - How to link with the correct C Run-Time (CRT) library\n\n - [KB190799](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235460) - Potential Errors Passing CRT Objects Across DLL Boundaries\n\nIf your app is misbehaving in some strange way, or it is suffering\nfrom memory corruption, before asking for further help, please try\nfirst to rebuild every single library your app uses as well as your\napp using the debug multithreaded dynamic C runtime.\n\n\n### MingW32\n\nMake sure that MinGW32's bin dir is in the search path, for example:\n\n    set PATH=c:\\mingw32\\bin;%PATH%\n\nthen run 'make -f Makefile.m32' in the root dir.\n\n\n### MSVC 6 caveats\n\nIf you use MSVC 6 it is required that you use the February 2003 edition PSDK:\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/psdk-full.htm\n\n\n### MSVC from command line\n\nRun the `vcvars32.bat` file to get a proper environment. The\n`vcvars32.bat` file is part of the Microsoft development environment and\nyou may find it in `C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\vc98\\bin`\nprovided that you installed Visual C/C++ 6 in the default directory.\n\nFurther details in [README.msvc](README.msvc)\n\n\n### Important static c-ares usage note\n\nWhen building an application that uses the static c-ares library, you must\nadd `-DCARES_STATICLIB` to your `CFLAGS`.  Otherwise the linker will look for\ndynamic import symbols.\n\n\nIBM OS/2\n--------\n\nBuilding under OS/2 is not much different from building under unix.\nYou need:\n\n  - emx 0.9d\n  - GNU make\n  - GNU patch\n  - ksh\n  - GNU bison\n  - GNU file utilities\n  - GNU sed\n  - autoconf 2.13\n\nIf during the linking you get an error about `_errno` being an undefined\nsymbol referenced from the text segment, you need to add `-D__ST_MT_ERRNO__`\nin your definitions.\n\nIf you're getting huge binaries, probably your makefiles have the `-g` in\n`CFLAGS`.\n\n\nNetWare\n-------\n\nTo compile `libcares.a` / `libcares.lib` you need:\n\n - either any gcc / nlmconv, or CodeWarrior 7 PDK 4 or later.\n - gnu make and awk running on the platform you compile on;\n   native Win32 versions can be downloaded from:\n   http://www.gknw.net/development/prgtools/\n - recent Novell LibC SDK available from:\n   http://developer.novell.com/ndk/libc.htm\n - or recent Novell CLib SDK available from:\n   http://developer.novell.com/ndk/clib.htm\n\nSet a search path to your compiler, linker and tools; on Linux make\nsure that the var `OSTYPE` contains the string 'linux'; set the var\n`NDKBASE` to point to the base of your Novell NDK; and then type\n`make -f Makefile.netware` from the top source directory;\n\nVCPKG\n=====\n\nYou can build and install c-ares using [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/) dependency manager:\n\n```sh or powershell\n    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git\n    cd vcpkg\n    ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh\n    ./vcpkg integrate install\n    ./vcpkg install c-ares\n```\n\nThe c-ares port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team members and community contributors. If the version is out of date, please [create an issue or pull request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) on the vcpkg repository.\n\nPORTS\n=====\n\nThis is a probably incomplete list of known hardware and operating systems\nthat c-ares has been compiled for.
