The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version.\n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.

If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/vendor/gems/sidekiq-reliable-fetch/LICENSE"}, {"result": {"value": "Apache License\n                        Version 2.0, January 2004\n                     http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n1.

Installation methods **(FREE SELF)**\n\nYou can install GitLab on several [cloud providers](cloud_providers.md),\nor use one of the following methods.\n\n| Installation method                                            | Description | When to choose |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------------|\n| [Linux package](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/installation/) (previously known as Omnibus GitLab) | The official `deb` and `rpm` packages. The Linux package has GitLab and dependent components, including PostgreSQL, Redis, and Sidekiq. | Use if you want the most mature, scalable method. This version is also used on GitLab.com. <br>- For additional flexibility and resilience, see the [reference architecture documentation](../administration/reference_architectures/index.md).<br>- Review the [system requirements](requirements.md).<br>- View the [list of supported Linux operating systems](../administration/package_information/supported_os.md#supported-operating-systems). |\n| [Helm chart](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/)                 | A chart for installing a cloud-native version of GitLab and its components on Kubernetes. | Use if your infrastructure is on Kubernetes and you're familiar with how it works. Management, observability, and some concepts are different than traditional deployments.<br/>- Administration and troubleshooting requires Kubernetes knowledge.<br/>- It can be more expensive for smaller installations. The default installation requires more resources than a single node Linux package deployment, because most services are deployed in a redundant fashion.<br/><br/>  |\n| [Docker](docker.md)              | The GitLab packages in a Docker container. | Use if you're familiar with Docker. |\n| [Source](installation.md)                                      | GitLab and its components from scratch. | Use if none of the previous methods are available for your platform. Can use for unsupported systems like \\*BSD.|\n| [GitLab Environment Toolkit (GET)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-environment-toolkit#documentation) | A set of opinionated Terraform and Ansible scripts. | Use to deploy a [reference architecture](../administration/reference_architectures/index.md) on selected major cloud providers. Has some [limitations](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-environment-toolkit#missing-features-to-be-aware-of) and manual setup for production environments. |\n| [GitLab Operator](https://docs.gitlab.com/operator/)   | An installation and management method that follows the [Kubernetes Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/). | Use to run GitLab in an [OpenShift](openshift_and_gitlab/index.md) environment. |\n\n## Unsupported Linux distributions and Unix-like operating systems\n\n- Arch Linux\n- Fedora\n- FreeBSD\n- Gentoo\n- macOS\n\nInstallation of GitLab on these operating systems is possible, but not supported.\nSee the [installation guides](https://about.gitlab.com/install/) for more information.\n\nSee [OS versions that are no longer supported](../administration/package_information/supported_os.md#os-versions-that-are-no-longer-supported)\nfor a list of supported and unsupported OS versions for Linux package installations as well as the last support GitLab version for that OS.\n\n## Microsoft Windows\n\nGitLab is developed for Linux-based operating systems.\nIt does **not** run on Microsoft Windows, and we have no plans to support it in the near future. For the latest development status, view this [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/22337).\nConsider using a virtual machine to run GitLab.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/install/install_methods.md"}, {"result": {"value": "---\nstage: Systems\ngroup: Distribution\ninfo: To determine the technical writer assigned to the Stage/Group associated with this page, see https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/technical-writing/#assignments\n---\n\n# Self-compiled installation **(FREE SELF)**\n\nThis is the official installation guide to set up a production GitLab server\nusing the source files. It was created for and tested on **Debian/Ubuntu** operating systems.\nRead [requirements.md](requirements.md) for hardware and operating system requirements.\nIf you want to install on RHEL/CentOS, you should use the [Linux packages](https://about.gitlab.com/install/).\nFor many other installation options, see the [main installation page](index.md).\n\nThis guide is long because it covers many cases and includes all commands you\nneed, this is [one of the few installation scripts that actually work out of the box](https://twitter.com/robinvdvleuten/status/424163226532986880).\nThe following steps have been known to work. **Use caution when you deviate**\nfrom this guide. Make sure you don't violate any assumptions GitLab makes about\nits environment. For example, many people run into permission problems because\nthey changed the location of directories or run services as the wrong user.\n\nIf you find a bug/error in this guide, **submit a merge request**\nfollowing the\n[contributing guide](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Consider the Linux package installation\n\nBecause a self-compiled installation is a lot of work and error prone, we strongly recommend the fast and reliable [Linux package installation](https://about.gitlab.com/install/) (deb/rpm).\n\nOne reason the Linux package is more reliable is its use of runit to restart any of the GitLab processes in case one crashes.\nOn heavily used GitLab instances the memory usage of the Sidekiq background worker grows over time.\nThe Linux packages solve this by [letting the Sidekiq terminate gracefully](../administration/sidekiq/sidekiq_memory_killer.md) if it uses too much memory.\nAfter this termination runit detects Sidekiq is not running and starts it.\nBecause self-compiled installations don't use runit for process supervision, Sidekiq\ncan't be terminated and its memory usage grows over time.\n\n## Select a version to install\n\nMake sure you view [this installation guide](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/install/installation.md) from the branch (version) of GitLab you would like to install (for example, `16-0-stable`).\nYou can select the branch in the version dropdown list in the upper-left corner of GitLab (below the menu bar).\n\nIf the highest number stable branch is unclear, check the [GitLab blog](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/) for installation guide links by version.\n\n## Software requirements\n\n| Software                | Minimum version | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|:------------------------|:----------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| [Ruby](#2-ruby)         | `3.1.x`         | From GitLab 16.7, Ruby 3.1 is required. You must use the standard MRI implementation of Ruby. We love [JRuby](https://www.jruby.org/) and [Rubinius](https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius#the-rubinius-language-platform), but GitLab needs several Gems that have native extensions. |\n| [RubyGems](#3-rubygems) | `3.4.x`         | A specific RubyGems version is not fully needed, but it's recommended to update so you can enjoy some known performance improvements.                                                                                                                                                  |\n| [Go](#4-go)             | `1.20.x`        | From GitLab 16.4, Go 1.20 or later is required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| [Git](#git)             | `2.42.x`        | From GitLab 16.5, Git 2.42.x and later is required. You should use the [Git version provided by Gitaly](#git).                                                                                                                                                   |\n| [Node.js](#5-node)      | `18.17.x`       | From GitLab 16.3, Node.js 18.17 or later is required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n\n## GitLab directory structure\n\nWhen following the instructions on this page, you create this directory structure:\n\n```plaintext\n|-- home\n|   |-- git\n|       |-- .ssh\n|       |-- gitlab\n|       |-- gitlab-shell\n|       |-- repositories\n```\n\n- `/home/git/.ssh` - Contains OpenSSH settings. Specifically, the `authorized_keys`\n  file managed by GitLab Shell.\n- `/home/git/gitlab` - GitLab core software.\n- `/home/git/gitlab-shell` - Core add-on component of GitLab. Maintains SSH\n  cloning and other functionality.\n- `/home/git/repositories` - Bare repositories for all projects organized by\n  namespace. This is where the Git repositories which are pushed/pulled are\n  maintained for all projects. **This area contains critical data for projects.\n  [Keep a backup](../administration/backup_restore/index.md).**\n\nThe default locations for repositories can be configured in `config/gitlab.yml`\nof GitLab and `config.yml` of GitLab Shell.\n\nFor a more in-depth overview, see the [GitLab architecture doc](../development/architecture.md).\n\n## Overview\n\nThe GitLab installation consists of setting up the following components:\n\n1. [Packages and dependencies](#1-packages-and-dependencies).\n1. [Ruby](#2-ruby).\n1. [RubyGems](#3-rubygems).\n1. [Go](#4-go).\n1. [Node](#5-node).\n1. [System users](#6-system-users).\n1. [Database](#7-database).\n1. [Redis](#8-redis).\n1. [GitLab](#9-gitlab).\n1. [NGINX](#10-nginx).\n\n## 1. Packages and dependencies\n\n### sudo\n\n`sudo` is not installed on Debian by default. Make sure your system is\nup-to-date and install it.\n\n```shell\n# run as root!\napt-get update -y\napt-get upgrade -y\napt-get install sudo -y\n```\n\n### Build dependencies\n\nInstall the required packages (needed to compile Ruby and native extensions to Ruby gems):\n\n```shell\nsudo apt-get install -y build-essential zlib1g-dev libyaml-dev libssl-dev libgdbm-dev libre2-dev \\\n  libreadline-dev libncurses5-dev libffi-dev curl openssh-server libxml2-dev libxslt-dev \\\n  libcurl4-openssl-dev libicu-dev libkrb5-dev logrotate rsync python3-docutils pkg-config cmake \\\n  runit-systemd\n```\n\nNOTE:\nGitLab requires OpenSSL version 1.1. If your Linux distribution includes a different version of OpenSSL,\nyou might have to install 1.1 manually.\n\n### Git\n\nFrom GitLab 13.6, we recommend you use the\n[Git version provided by Gitaly](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/issues/2729)\nthat:\n\n- Is always at the version required by GitLab.\n- May contain custom patches required for proper operation.\n\n1. Install the needed dependencies:\n\n   ```shell\n   sudo apt-get install -y libcurl4-openssl-dev libexpat1-dev gettext libz-dev libssl-dev libpcre2-dev build-essential git-core\n   ```\n\n1. Clone the Gitaly repository and compile Git. Replace `<X-Y-stable>` with the\n   stable branch that matches the GitLab version you want to install. For example,\n   if you want to install GitLab 13.6, use the branch name `13-6-stable`:\n\n   ```shell\n   git clone https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly.git -b <X-Y-stable> /tmp/gitaly\n   cd /tmp/gitaly\n   sudo make git GIT_PREFIX=/usr/local\n   ```\n\n1. Optionally, you can remove the system Git and its dependencies:\n\n   ```shell\n   sudo apt remove -y git-core\n   sudo apt autoremove\n   ```\n\nWhen [editing `config/gitlab.yml` later](#configure-it), remember to change\nthe Git path:\n\n- From:\n\n  ```yaml\n  git:\n    bin_path: /usr/bin/git\n  ```\n\n- To:\n\n  ```yaml\n  git:\n    bin_path: /usr/local/bin/git\n  ```\n\n### GraphicsMagick\n\nFor the [Custom Favicon](../administration/appearance.md#favicon) to work, GraphicsMagick\nmust be installed.\n\n```shell\nsudo apt-get install -y graphicsmagick\n```\n\n### Mail server\n\nTo receive mail notifications, make sure to install a mail server.\nBy default, Debian is shipped with `exim4` but this\n[has problems](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/12754) while\nUbuntu does not ship with one. The recommended mail server is `postfix` and you\ncan install it with:\n\n```shell\nsudo apt-get install -y postfix\n```\n\nThen select 'Internet Site' and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to confirm the hostname.\n\n### ExifTool\n\n[GitLab Workhorse](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-workhorse#dependencies)\nrequires `exiftool` to remove EXIF data from uploaded images.\n\n```shell\nsudo apt-get install -y libimage-exiftool-perl\n```\n\n## 2. Ruby\n\nThe Ruby interpreter is required to run GitLab.\nSee the [requirements section](#software-requirements) for the minimum\nRuby requirements.\n\nThe use of Ruby version managers such as [`RVM`](https://rvm.io/), [`rbenv`](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) or [`chruby`](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby) with GitLab\nin production, frequently leads to hard to diagnose problems. Version managers\nare not supported and we strongly advise everyone to follow the instructions\nbelow to use a system Ruby.\n\nLinux distributions generally have older versions of Ruby available, so these\ninstructions are designed to install Ruby from the official source code.\n\n[Install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).\n\n## 3. RubyGems\n\nSometimes, a newer version of RubyGems is required than the one bundled with Ruby.\n\nTo update to a specific version:\n\n```shell\ngem update --system 3.4.12\n```\n\nOr the latest version:\n\n```shell\ngem update --system\n```\n\n## 4. Go\n\nGitLab has several daemons written in Go. To install\nGitLab we need a Go compiler. The instructions below assume you use 64-bit\nLinux. You can find downloads for other platforms at the\n[Go download page](https://go.dev/dl).\n\n```shell\n# Remove former Go installation folder\nsudo rm -rf /usr/local/go\n\ncurl --remote-name --location --progress-bar \"https://go.dev/dl/go1.20.8.linux-amd64.tar.gz\"\necho 'cc97c28d9c252fbf28f91950d830201aa403836cbed702a05932e63f7f0c7bc4  go1.20.8.linux-amd64.tar.gz' | shasum -a256 -c - && \\\n  sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.20.8.linux-amd64.tar.gz\nsudo ln -sf /usr/local/go/bin/{go,gofmt} /usr/local/bin/\nrm go1.20.8.linux-amd64.tar.gz\n```\n\n## 5. Node\n\nGitLab requires the use of Node to compile JavaScript\nassets, and Yarn to manage JavaScript dependencies. The current minimum\nrequirements for these are:\n\n- `node` 18.x releases (v18.17.0 or later).\n  [Other LTS versions of Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule) might be able to build assets, but we only guarantee Node.js 18.x.\n- `yarn` = v1.22.x (Yarn 2 is not supported yet)\n\nIn many distributions,\nthe versions provided by the official package repositories are out of date, so\nwe must install through the following commands:\n\n```shell\n# install node v18.x\ncurl --location \"https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x\" | sudo bash -\nsudo apt-get install -y nodejs\n\nnpm install --global yarn\n```\n\nVisit the official websites for [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) if you have any trouble with these steps.\n\n## 6. System users\n\nCreate a `git` user for GitLab:\n\n```shell\nsudo adduser --disabled-login --gecos 'GitLab' git\n```\n\n## 7. Database\n\nNOTE:\nIn GitLab 12.1 and later, only PostgreSQL is supported. In GitLab 16.0 and later, we [require PostgreSQL 13+](requirements.md#postgresql-requirements).\n\n1. Install the database packages.\n\n   For Ubuntu 22.04 and later:\n\n   ```shell\n   sudo apt install -y postgresql postgresql-client libpq-dev postgresql-contrib\n   ```\n\n   For Ubuntu 20.04 and earlier, the available PostgreSQL doesn't meet the minimum\n   version requirement. You must add PostgreSQL's repository:\n\n   ```shell\n   sudo sh -c 'echo \"deb https://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'\n   wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get -y install postgresql-14\n   ```\n\n1. Verify the PostgreSQL version you have is supported by the version of GitLab you're\n   installing:\n\n   ```shell\n   psql --version\n   ```\n\n1. Start the PostgreSQL service and confirm that the service is running:\n\n   ```shell\n   sudo service postgresql start\n   sudo service postgresql status\n   ```\n\n1. Create a database user for GitLab:\n\n   ```shell\n   sudo -u postgres psql -d template1 -c \"CREATE USER git CREATEDB;\"\n   ```\n\n1. Create the `pg_trgm` extension:\n\n   ```shell\n   sudo -u postgres psql -d template1 -c \"CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;\"\n   ```\n\n1. Create the `btree_gist` extension (required for GitLab 13.1+):\n\n   ```shell\n   sudo -u postgres psql -d template1 -c \"CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS btree_gist;\"\n   ```\n\n1. Create the `plpgsql` extension:\n\n   ```shell\n   sudo -u postgres psql -d template1 -c \"CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS plpgsql;\"\n   ```\n\n1. Create the GitLab production database and grant all privileges on the database:\n\n   ```shell\n   sudo -u postgres psql -d template1 -c \"CREATE DATABASE gitlabhq_production OWNER git;\"\n   ```\n\n1. Try connecting to the new database with the new user:\n\n   ```shell\n   sudo -u git -H psql -d gitlabhq_production\n   ```\n\n1. Check if the `pg_trgm` extension is enabled:\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT true AS enabled\n   FROM pg_available_extensions\n   WHERE name = 'pg_trgm'\n   AND installed_version IS NOT NULL;\n   ```\n\n   If the extension is enabled this produces the following output:\n\n   ```plaintext\n   enabled\n   ---------\n    t\n   (1 row)\n   ```\n\n1. Check if the `btree_gist` extension is enabled:\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT true AS enabled\n   FROM pg_available_extensions\n   WHERE name = 'btree_gist'\n   AND installed_version IS NOT NULL;\n   ```\n\n   If the extension is enabled this produces the following output:\n\n   ```plaintext\n   enabled\n   ---------\n    t\n   (1 row)\n   ```\n\n1. Check if the `plpgsql` extension is enabled:\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT true AS enabled\n   FROM pg_available_extensions\n   WHERE name = 'plpgsql'\n   AND installed_version IS NOT NULL;\n   ```\n\n   If the extension is enabled this produces the following output:\n\n   ```plaintext\n   enabled\n   ---------\n    t\n   (1 row)\n   ```\n\n1. Quit the database session:\n\n   ```shell\n   gitlabhq_production> \\q\n   ```\n\n## 8. Redis\n\nSee the [requirements page](requirements.md#redis) for the minimum\nRedis requirements.\n\nInstall Redis with:\n\n```shell\nsudo apt-get install redis-server\n```\n\nOnce done, you can configure Redis:\n\n```shell\n# Configure redis to use sockets\nsudo cp /etc/redis/redis.conf /etc/redis/redis.conf.orig\n\n# Disable Redis listening on TCP by setting 'port' to 0\nsudo sed 's/^port .*/port 0/' /etc/redis/redis.conf.orig | sudo tee /etc/redis/redis.conf\n\n# Enable Redis socket for default Debian / Ubuntu path\necho 'unixsocket /var/run/redis/redis.sock' | sudo tee -a /etc/redis/redis.conf\n\n# Grant permission to the socket to all members of the redis group\necho 'unixsocketperm 770' | sudo tee -a /etc/redis/redis.conf\n\n# Add git to the redis group\nsudo usermod -aG redis git\n```\n\n### Supervise Redis with systemd\n\nIf your distribution uses systemd init and the output of the following command is `notify`,\nyou must not make any changes:\n\n```shell\nsystemctl show --value --property=Type redis-server.service\n```\n\nIf the output is **not** `notify`, run:\n\n```shell\n# Configure Redis to not daemonize, but be supervised by systemd instead and disable the pidfile\nsudo sed -i \\\n         -e 's/^daemonize yes$/daemonize no/' \\\n         -e 's/^supervised no$/supervised systemd/' \\\n         -e 's/^pidfile/# pidfile/' /etc/redis/redis.conf\nsudo chown redis:redis /etc/redis/redis.conf\n\n# Make the same changes to the systemd unit file\nsudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/redis-server.service.d\nsudo tee /etc/systemd/system/redis-server.service.d/10fix_type.conf <<EOF\n[Service]\nType=notify\nPIDFile=\nEOF\n\n# Reload the redis service\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload\n\n# Activate the changes to redis.conf\nsudo systemctl restart redis-server.service\n```\n\n### Leave Redis unsupervised\n\nIf your system uses SysV init, run these commands:\n\n```shell\n# Create the directory which contains the socket\nsudo mkdir -p /var/run/redis\nsudo chown redis:redis /var/run/redis\nsudo chmod 755 /var/run/redis\n\n# Persist the directory which contains the socket, if applicable\nif [ -d /etc/tmpfiles.d ]; then\n  echo 'd  /var/run/redis  0755  redis  redis  10d  -' | sudo tee -a /etc/tmpfiles.d/redis.conf\nfi\n\n# Activate the changes to redis.conf\nsudo service redis-server restart\n```\n\n## 9. GitLab\n\n```shell\n# We'll install GitLab into the home directory of the user \"git\"\ncd /home/git\n```\n\n### Clone the Source\n\nClone Community Edition:\n\n```shell\n# Clone GitLab repository\nsudo -u git -H git clone https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss.git -b <X-Y-stable> gitlab\n```\n\nClone Enterprise Edition:\n\n```shell\n# Clone GitLab repository\nsudo -u git -H git clone https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab.git -b <X-Y-stable-ee> gitlab\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `<X-Y-stable>` with the stable branch that matches the\nversion you want to install. For example, if you want to install 11.8 you would\nuse the branch name `11-8-stable`.\n\nWARNING:\nYou can change `<X-Y-stable>` to `master` if you want the *bleeding edge* version, but never install `master` on a production server!\n\n### Configure It\n\n```shell\n# Go to GitLab installation folder\ncd /home/git/gitlab\n\n# Copy the example GitLab config\nsudo -u git -H cp config/gitlab.yml.example config/gitlab.yml\n\n# Update GitLab config file, follow the directions at top of the file\nsudo -u git -H editor config/gitlab.yml\n\n# Copy the example secrets file\nsudo -u git -H cp config/secrets.yml.example config/secrets.yml\nsudo -u git -H chmod 0600 config/secrets.yml\n\n# Make sure GitLab can write to the log/ and tmp/ directories\nsudo chown -R git log/\nsudo chown -R git tmp/\nsudo chmod -R u+rwX,go-w log/\nsudo chmod -R u+rwX tmp/\n\n# Make sure GitLab can write to the tmp/pids/ and tmp/sockets/ directories\nsudo chmod -R u+rwX tmp/pids/\nsudo chmod -R u+rwX tmp/sockets/\n\n# Create the public/uploads/ directory\nsudo -u git -H mkdir -p public/uploads/\n\n# Make sure only the GitLab user has access to the public/uploads/ directory\n# now that files in public/uploads are served by gitlab-workhorse\nsudo chmod 0700 public/uploads\n\n# Change the permissions of the directory where CI job logs are stored\nsudo chmod -R u+rwX builds/\n\n# Change the permissions of the directory where CI artifacts are stored\nsudo chmod -R u+rwX shared/artifacts/\n\n# Change the permissions of the directory where GitLab Pages are stored\nsudo chmod -R ug+rwX shared/pages/\n\n# Copy the example Puma config\nsudo -u git -H cp config/puma.rb.example config/puma.rb\n\n# Refer to https://github.com/puma/puma#configuration for more information.\n# You should scale Puma workers and threads based on the number of CPU\n# cores you have available. You can get that number via the `nproc` command.\nsudo -u git -H editor config/puma.rb\n\n# Configure Redis connection settings\nsudo -u git -H cp config/resque.yml.example config/resque.yml\nsudo -u git -H cp config/cable.yml.example config/cable.yml\n\n# Change the Redis socket path if you are not using the default Debian / Ubuntu configuration\nsudo -u git -H editor config/resque.yml config/cable.yml\n```\n\nMake sure to edit both `gitlab.yml` and `puma.rb` to match your setup.\n\nIf you want to use HTTPS, see [Using HTTPS](#using-https) for the additional steps.\n\n### Configure GitLab DB Settings\n\nNOTE:\nFrom [GitLab 15.9](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/387898), `database.yml` with only a section: `main:` is deprecated.\nIn GitLab 17.0 and later, you must have the two `main:` and `ci:` sections in your `database.yml`.\n\n```shell\nsudo -u git cp config/database.yml.postgresql config/database.yml\n\n# Remove host, username, and password lines from config/database.yml.\n# Once modified, the `production` settings will be as follows:\n#\n#   production:\n#     main:\n#       adapter: postgresql\n#       encoding: unicode\n#       database: gitlabhq_production\n#     ci:\n#       adapter: postgresql\n#       encoding: unicode\n#       database: gitlabhq_production\n#       database_tasks: false\n#\nsudo -u git -H editor config/database.yml\n\n# Remote PostgreSQL only:\n# Update username/password in config/database.yml.\n# You only need to adapt the production settings (first part).\n# If you followed the database guide then please do as follows:\n# Change 'secure password' with the value you have given to $password\n# You can keep the double quotes around the password\nsudo -u git -H editor config/database.yml\n\n# Uncomment the `ci:` sections in config/database.yml.\n# Ensure the `database` value in `ci:` matches the database value in `main:`.\n\n# Make config/database.yml readable to git only\nsudo -u git -H chmod o-rwx config/database.yml\n```\n\nYou should have two sections in your `database.yml`: `main:` and `ci:`. The `ci`:\nconnection [must be to the same database](../administration/postgresql/multiple_databases.md).\nIf, for any reason, you wish to remain on a single database connection, remove the `ci:`\nsection from `config/database.yml`.\n\n### Install Gems\n\nNOTE:\nAs of Bundler 1.5.2, you can invoke `bundle install -jN` (where `N` is the number of your processor cores) and enjoy parallel gems installation with measurable difference in completion time (~60% faster). Check the number of your cores with `nproc`. For more information, see this [post](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/parallel-gem-installing-using-bundler).\n\nMake sure you have `bundle` (run `bundle -v`):\n\n- `>= 1.5.2`, because some [issues](https://devcenter.heroku.com/changelog-items/411) were [fixed](https://github.com/rubygems/bundler/pull/2817) in 1.5.2.\n- `< 2.x`.\n\nInstall the gems (if you want to use Kerberos for user authentication, omit\n`kerberos` in the `--without` option below):\n\n```shell\nsudo -u git -H bundle config set --local deployment 'true'\nsudo -u git -H bundle config set --local without 'development test kerberos'\nsudo -u git -H bundle config path /home/git/gitlab/vendor/bundle\nsudo -u git -H bundle install\n```\n\n### Install GitLab Shell\n\nGitLab Shell is an SSH access and repository management software developed specially for GitLab.\n\n```shell\n# Run the installation task for gitlab-shell:\nsudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:shell:install RAILS_ENV=production\n\n# By default, the gitlab-shell config is generated from your main GitLab config.\n# You can review (and modify) the gitlab-shell config as follows:\nsudo -u git -H editor /home/git/gitlab-shell/config.yml\n```\n\nIf you want to use HTTPS, see [Using HTTPS](#using-https) for the additional steps.\n\nMake sure your hostname can be resolved on the machine itself by either a proper DNS record or an additional line in `/etc/hosts` (\"127.0.0.1 hostname\"). This might be necessary, for example, if you set up GitLab behind a reverse proxy. If the hostname cannot be resolved, the final installation check fails with `Check GitLab API access: FAILED. code: 401` and pushing commits are rejected with `[remote rejected] master -> master (hook declined)`.\n\n### Install GitLab Workhorse\n\nGitLab-Workhorse uses [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). The\nfollowing command-line installs GitLab-Workhorse in `/home/git/gitlab-workhorse`\nwhich is the recommended location.\n\n```shell\nsudo -u git -H bundle exec rake \"gitlab:workhorse:install[/home/git/gitlab-workhorse]\" RAILS_ENV=production\n```\n\nYou can specify a different Git repository by providing it as an extra parameter:\n\n```shell\nsudo -u git -H bundle exec rake \"gitlab:workhorse:install[/home/git/gitlab-workhorse,https://example.com/gitlab-workhorse.git]\" RAILS_ENV=production\n```\n\n### Install GitLab-Elasticsearch-indexer on Enterprise Edition **(PREMIUM SELF)**\n\nGitLab-Elasticsearch-Indexer uses [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). The\nfollowing command-line installs GitLab-Elasticsearch-Indexer in `/home/git/gitlab-elasticsearch-indexer`\nwhich is the recommended location.\n\n```shell\nsudo -u git -H bundle exec rake \"gitlab:indexer:install[/home/git/gitlab-elasticsearch-indexer]\" RAILS_ENV=production\n```\n\nYou can specify a different Git repository by providing it as an extra parameter:\n\n```shell\nsudo -u git -H bundle exec rake \"gitlab:indexer:install[/home/git/gitlab-elasticsearch-indexer,https://example.com/gitlab-elasticsearch-indexer.git]\" RAILS_ENV=production\n```\n\nThe source code first is fetched to the path specified by the first parameter. Then a binary is built under its `bin` directory.\nYou must then update `gitlab.yml`'s `production -> elasticsearch -> indexer_path` setting to point to that binary.\n\n### Install GitLab Pages\n\nGitLab Pages uses [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). This step is optional and only needed if you wish to host static sites from within GitLab. The following commands install GitLab Pages in `/home/git/gitlab-pages`. For additional setup steps, consult the [administration guide](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/administration/pages/source.md) for your version of GitLab as the GitLab Pages daemon can be run several different ways.\n\n```shell\ncd /home/git\nsudo -u git -H git clone https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-pages.git\ncd gitlab-pages\nsudo -u git -H git checkout v$(</home/git/gitlab/GITLAB_PAGES_VERSION)\nsudo -u git -H make\n```\n\n### Install Gitaly\n\n```shell\n# Create and restrict access to the git repository data directory\nsudo install -d -o git -m 0700 /home/git/repositories\n\n# Fetch Gitaly source with Git and compile with Go\ncd /home/git/gitlab\nsudo -u git -H bundle exec rake \"gitlab:gitaly:install[/home/git/gitaly,/home/git/repositories]\" RAILS_ENV=production\n```\n\nYou can specify a different Git repository by providing it as an extra parameter:\n\n```shell\nsudo -u git -H bundle exec rake \"gitlab:gitaly:install[/home/git/gitaly,/home/git/repositories,https://example.com/gitaly.git]\" RAILS_ENV=production\n```\n\nNext, make sure that Gitaly is configured:\n\n```shell\n# Restrict Gitaly socket access\nsudo chmod 0700 /home/git/gitlab/tmp/sockets/private\nsudo chown git /home/git/gitlab/tmp/sockets/private\n\n# If you are using non-default settings, you need to update config.toml\ncd /home/git/gitaly\nsudo -u git -H editor config.toml\n```\n\nFor more information about configuring Gitaly see\n[the Gitaly documentation](../administration/gitaly/index.md).\n\n### Install the service\n\nGitLab has always supported SysV init scripts, which are widely supported and portable, but now systemd is the standard for service supervision and is used by all major Linux distributions. You should use native systemd services if you can to benefit from automatic restarts, better sandboxing and resource control.\n\n#### Install systemd units\n\nUse these steps if you use systemd as init. Otherwise, follow the [SysV init script steps](#install-sysv-init-script).\n\nCopy the services and run `systemctl daemon-reload` so that systemd picks them up:\n\n```shell\ncd /home/git/gitlab\nsudo mkdir -p /usr/local/lib/systemd/system\nsudo cp lib/support/systemd/* /usr/local/lib/systemd/system/\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload\n```\n\nThe units provided by GitLab make very little assumptions about where you are running Redis and PostgreSQL.\n\nIf you installed GitLab in another directory or as a user other than the default, you must change these values in the units as well.\n\nFor example, if you're running Redis and PostgreSQL on the same machine as GitLab, you should:\n\n- Edit the Puma service:\n\n  ```shell\n  sudo systemctl edit gitlab-puma.service\n  ```\n\n  In the editor that opens, add the following and save the file:\n\n  ```plaintext\n  [Unit]\n  Wants=redis-server.service postgresql.service\n  After=redis-server.service postgresql.service\n  ```\n\n- Edit the Sidekiq service:\n\n  ```shell\n  sudo systemctl edit gitlab-sidekiq.service\n  ```\n\n  Add the following and save the file:\n\n  ```plaintext\n  [Unit]\n  Wants=redis-server.service postgresql.service\n  After=redis-server.service postgresql.service\n  ```\n\n`systemctl edit` installs drop-in configuration files at `/etc/systemd/system/<name of the unit>.d/override.conf`, so your local configuration is not overwritten when updating the unit files later. To split up your drop-in configuration files, you can add the above snippets to `.conf` files under `/etc/systemd/system/<name of the unit>.d/`.\n\nIf you manually made changes to the unit files or added drop-in configuration files (without using `systemctl edit`), run the following command for them to take effect:\n\n```shell\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload\n```\n\nMake GitLab start on boot:\n\n```shell\nsudo systemctl enable gitlab.target\n```\n\n#### Install SysV init script\n\nUse these steps if you use the SysV init script. If you use systemd, follow the [systemd unit steps](#install-systemd-units).\n\nDownload the init script (is `/etc/init.d/gitlab`):\n\n```shell\ncd /home/git/gitlab\nsudo cp lib/support/init.d/gitlab /etc/init.d/gitlab\n```\n\nAnd if you are installing with a non-default folder or user, copy and edit the defaults file:\n\n```shell\nsudo cp lib/support/init.d/gitlab.default.example /etc/default/gitlab\n```\n\nIf you installed GitLab in another directory or as a user other than the default, you should change these settings in `/etc/default/gitlab`. Do not edit `/etc/init.d/gitlab` as it is changed on upgrade.\n\nMake GitLab start on boot:\n\n```shell\nsudo update-rc.d gitlab defaults 21\n# or if running this on a machine running systemd\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload\nsudo systemctl enable gitlab.service\n```\n\n### Set up Logrotate\n\n```shell\nsudo cp lib/support/logrotate/gitlab /etc/logrotate.d/gitlab\n```\n\n### Start Gitaly\n\nGitaly must be running for the next section.\n\n- To start Gitaly using systemd:\n\n  ```shell\n  sudo systemctl start gitlab-gitaly.service\n  ```\n\n- To manually start Gitaly for SysV:\n\n  ```shell\n  gitlab_path=/home/git/gitlab\n  gitaly_path=/home/git/gitaly\n\n  sudo -u git -H sh -c \"$gitlab_path/bin/daemon_with_pidfile $gitlab_path/tmp/pids/gitaly.pid \\\n    $gitaly_path/_build/bin/gitaly $gitaly_path/config.toml >> $gitlab_path/log/gitaly.log 2>&1 &\"\n  ```\n\n### Initialize Database and Activate Advanced Features\n\n```shell\ncd /home/git/gitlab\nsudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:setup RAILS_ENV=production\n# Type 'yes' to create the database tables.\n\n# or you can skip the question by adding force=yes\nsudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:setup RAILS_ENV=production force=yes\n\n# When done, you see 'Administrator account created:'\n```\n\nYou can set the Administrator/root password and email by supplying them in environmental variables, `GITLAB_ROOT_PASSWORD` and `GITLAB_ROOT_EMAIL`, as seen below. If you don't set the password (and it is set to the default one), wait to expose GitLab to the public internet until the installation is done and you've logged into the server the first time. During the first login, you are forced to change the default password. An Enterprise Edition subscription may also be activated at this time by supplying the activation code in the `GITLAB_ACTIVATION_CODE` environment variable.\n\n```shell\nsudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:setup RAILS_ENV=production GITLAB_ROOT_PASSWORD=yourpassword GITLAB_ROOT_EMAIL=youremail GITLAB_ACTIVATION_CODE=yourcode\n```\n\n### Secure `secrets.yml`\n\nThe `secrets.yml` file stores encryption keys for sessions and secure variables.\nBackup `secrets.yml` someplace safe, but don't store it in the same place as your database backups.\nOtherwise, your secrets are exposed if one of your backups is compromised.\n\n### Check Application Status\n\nCheck if GitLab and its environment are configured correctly:\n\n```shell\nsudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:env:info RAILS_ENV=production\n```\n\n### Compile Assets\n\n```shell\nsudo -u git -H yarn install --production --pure-lockfile\nsudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:assets:compile RAILS_ENV=production NODE_ENV=production\n```\n\nIf `rake` fails with `JavaScript heap out of memory` error, try to run it with `NODE_OPTIONS` set as follows.\n\n```shell\nsudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:assets:compile RAILS_ENV=production NODE_ENV=production NODE_OPTIONS=\"--max_old_space_size=4096\"\n```\n\n### Start Your GitLab Instance\n\n```shell\n# For systems running systemd\nsudo systemctl start gitlab.target\n\n# For systems running SysV init\nsudo service gitlab start\n```\n\n## 10. NGINX\n\nNGINX is the officially supported web server for GitLab. If you cannot or do not want to use NGINX as your web server, see [GitLab recipes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-recipes/).\n\n### Installation\n\n```shell\nsudo apt-get install -y nginx\n```\n\n### Site Configuration\n\nCopy the example site configuration:\n\n```shell\nsudo cp lib/support/nginx/gitlab /etc/nginx/sites-available/gitlab\nsudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/gitlab /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/gitlab\n```\n\nMake sure to edit the configuration file to match your setup. Also, ensure that you match your paths to GitLab, especially if installing for a user other than the `git` user:\n\n```shell\n# Change YOUR_SERVER_FQDN to the fully-qualified\n# domain name of your host serving GitLab.\n#\n# Remember to match your paths to GitLab, especially\n# if installing for a user other than 'git'.\n#\n# If using Ubuntu default nginx install:\n# either remove the default_server from the listen line\n# or else sudo rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default\nsudo editor /etc/nginx/sites-available/gitlab\n```\n\nIf you intend to enable GitLab Pages, there is a separate NGINX configuration you need\nto use. Read all about the needed configuration at the\n[GitLab Pages administration guide](../administration/pages/index.md).\n\nIf you want to use HTTPS, replace the `gitlab` NGINX configuration with `gitlab-ssl`. See [Using HTTPS](#using-https) for HTTPS configuration details.\n\nFor the NGINX to be able to read the GitLab-Workhorse socket, you must make sure, that the `www-data` user can read the socket, which is owned by the GitLab user. This is achieved, if it is world-readable, for example that it has permissions `0755`, which is the default. `www-data` also must be able to list the parent directories.\n\n### Test Configuration\n\nValidate your `gitlab` or `gitlab-ssl` NGINX configuration file with the following command:\n\n```shell\nsudo nginx -t\n```\n\nYou should receive `syntax is okay` and `test is successful` messages. If you\nreceive error messages, check your `gitlab` or `gitlab-ssl` NGINX configuration\nfile for typos, as indicated in the provided error message.\n\nVerify that the installed version is greater than 1.12.1:\n\n```shell\nnginx -v\n```\n\nIf it's lower, you may receive the error below:\n\n```plaintext\nnginx: [emerg] unknown \"start$temp=[filtered]$rest\" variable\nnginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test failed\n```\n\n### Restart\n\n```shell\n# For systems running systemd\nsudo systemctl restart nginx.service\n\n# For systems running SysV init\nsudo service nginx restart\n```\n\n## Post-install\n\n### Double-check Application Status\n\nTo make sure you didn't miss anything run a more thorough check with:\n\n```shell\nsudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:check RAILS_ENV=production\n```\n\nIf all items are green, congratulations on successfully installing GitLab!\n\nNOTE:\nSupply the `SANITIZE=true` environment variable to `gitlab:check` to omit project names from the output of the check command.\n\n### Initial Login\n\nVisit YOUR_SERVER in your web browser for your first GitLab login.\n\nIf you didn't [provide a root password during setup](#initialize-database-and-activate-advanced-features),\nyou are redirected to a password reset screen to provide the password for the\ninitial administrator account. Enter your desired password and you are\nredirected back to the login screen.\n\nThe default account's username is **root**. Provide the password you created\nearlier and login. After login, you can change the username if you wish.\n\n**Enjoy!**\n\nTo start and stop GitLab when using:\n\n- systemd units: use `sudo systemctl start gitlab.target` or `sudo systemctl stop gitlab.target`.\n- The SysV init script: use `sudo service gitlab start` or `sudo service gitlab stop`.\n\n### Recommended next steps\n\nAfter completing your installation, consider taking the\n[recommended next steps](next_steps.md), including authentication options\nand sign-up restrictions.\n\n## Advanced Setup Tips\n\n### Relative URL support\n\nSee the [Relative URL documentation](relative_url.md) for more information on\nhow to configure GitLab with a relative URL.\n\n### Using HTTPS\n\nTo use GitLab with HTTPS:\n\n1. In `gitlab.yml`:\n   1. Set the `port` option in section 1 to `443`.\n   1. Set the `https` option in section 1 to `true`.\n1. In the `config.yml` of GitLab Shell:\n   1. Set `gitlab_url` option to the HTTPS endpoint of GitLab (for example, `https://git.example.com`).\n   1. Set the certificates using either the `ca_file` or `ca_path` option.\n1. Use the `gitlab-ssl` NGINX example configuration instead of the `gitlab` configuration.\n   1. Update `YOUR_SERVER_FQDN`.\n   1. Update `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key`.\n   1. Review the configuration file and consider applying other security and performance enhancing features.\n\nUsing a self-signed certificate is discouraged. If you must use one,\nfollow the standard directions and generate a self-signed SSL certificate:\n\n   ```shell\n   mkdir -p /etc/nginx/ssl/\n   cd /etc/nginx/ssl/\n   sudo openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -x509 -nodes -days 3560 -out gitlab.crt -keyout gitlab.key\n   sudo chmod o-r gitlab.key\n   ```\n\n### Enable Reply by email\n\nSee the [\"Reply by email\" documentation](../administration/reply_by_email.md) for more information on how to set this up.\n\n### LDAP Authentication\n\nYou can configure LDAP authentication in `config/gitlab.yml`. Restart GitLab after editing this file.\n\n### Using Custom OmniAuth Providers\n\nSee the [OmniAuth integration documentation](../integration/omniauth.md).\n\n### Build your projects\n\nGitLab can build your projects. To enable that feature, you need runners to do that for you.\nSee the [GitLab Runner section](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/) to install it.\n\n### Adding your Trusted Proxies\n\nIf you are using a reverse proxy on a separate machine, you may want to add the\nproxy to the trusted proxies list. Otherwise users appear signed in from the\nproxy's IP address.\n\nYou can add trusted proxies in `config/gitlab.yml` by customizing the `trusted_proxies`\noption in section 1. Save the file and [reconfigure GitLab](../administration/restart_gitlab.md)\nfor the changes to take effect.\n\n### Custom Redis Connection\n\nIf you'd like to connect to a Redis server on a non-standard port or a different host, you can configure its connection string via the `config/resque.yml` file.\n\n```yaml\n# example\nproduction:\n  url: redis://redis.example.tld:6379\n```\n\nIf you want to connect the Redis server via socket, use the `unix:` URL scheme and the path to the Redis socket file in the `config/resque.yml` file.\n\n```yaml\n# example\nproduction:\n  url: unix:/path/to/redis/socket\n```\n\nAlso, you can use environment variables in the `config/resque.yml` file:\n\n```yaml\n# example\nproduction:\n  url: <%= ENV.fetch('GITLAB_REDIS_URL') %>\n```\n\n### Custom SSH Connection\n\nIf you are running SSH on a non-standard port, you must change the GitLab user's SSH configuration.\n\n```plaintext\n# Add to /home/git/.ssh/config\nhost localhost          # Give your setup a name (here: override localhost)\n    user git            # Your remote git user\n    port 2222           # Your port number\n    hostname 127.0.0.1; # Your server name or IP\n```\n\nYou must also change the corresponding options (for example, `ssh_user`, `ssh_host`, `admin_uri`) in the `config/gitlab.yml` file.\n\n### Additional Markup Styles\n\nApart from the always supported Markdown style, there are other rich text files that GitLab can display. But you might have to install a dependency to do so. See the [`github-markup` gem README](https://github.com/gitlabhq/markup#markups) for more information.\n\n### Prometheus server setup\n\nYou can configure the Prometheus server in `config/gitlab.yml`:\n\n```yaml\n# example\nprometheus:\n  enabled: true\n  server_address: '10.1.2.3:9090'\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### \"You appear to have cloned an empty repository.\"\n\nIf you see this message when attempting to clone a repository hosted by GitLab,\nthis is likely due to an outdated NGINX or Apache configuration, or a missing or\nmisconfigured GitLab Workhorse instance. Double-check that you've\n[installed Go](#4-go), [installed GitLab Workhorse](#install-gitlab-workhorse),\nand correctly [configured NGINX](#site-configuration).\n\n### `google-protobuf` \"LoadError: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version 'GLIBC_2.14' not found\"\n\nThis can happen on some platforms for some versions of the\n`google-protobuf` gem. The workaround is to install a source-only\nversion of this gem.\n\nFirst, you must find the exact version of `google-protobuf` that your\nGitLab installation requires:\n\n```shell\ncd /home/git/gitlab\n\n# Only one of the following two commands will print something. It\n# will look like: * google-protobuf (3.2.0)\nbundle list | grep google-protobuf\nbundle check | grep google-protobuf\n```\n\nBelow, `3.2.0` is used as an example. Replace it with the version number\nyou found above:\n\n```shell\ncd /home/git/gitlab\nsudo -u git -H gem install google-protobuf --version 3.2.0 --platform ruby\n```\n\nFinally, you can test whether `google-protobuf` loads correctly. The\nfollowing should print 'OK'.\n\n```shell\nsudo -u git -H bundle exec ruby -rgoogle/protobuf -e 'puts :OK'\n```\n\nIf the `gem install` command fails, you may need to install the developer\ntools of your OS.\n\nOn Debian/Ubuntu:\n\n```shell\nsudo apt-get install build-essential libgmp-dev\n```\n\nOn RedHat/CentOS:\n\n```shell\nsudo yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'\n```\n\n### Error compiling GitLab assets\n\nWhile compiling assets, you may receive the following error message:\n\n```plaintext\nKilled\nerror Command failed with exit code 137.\n```\n\nThis can occur when Yarn kills a container that runs out of memory. To fix this:\n\n1. Increase your system's memory to at least 8 GB.\n\n1. Run this command to clean the assets:\n\n   ```shell\n   sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:assets:clean RAILS_ENV=production NODE_ENV=production\n   ```\n\n1. Run the `yarn` command again to resolve any conflicts:\n\n   ```shell\n   sudo -u git -H yarn install --production --pure-lockfile\n   ```\n\n1. Recompile the assets:\n\n   ```shell\n   sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:assets:compile RAILS_ENV=production NODE_ENV=production\n   ```\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique":
