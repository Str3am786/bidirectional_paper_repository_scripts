Keras release notes.\r\n\r\n# Major Features and Improvements\r\n\r\n*   `tf.keras`:\r\n    *   Added `tf.keras.applications.resnet_rs` models.  This includes the `ResNetRS50`, `ResNetRS101`, `ResNetRS152`, `ResNetRS200`, `ResNetRS270`, `ResNetRS350` and `ResNetRS420` model architectures. The ResNetRS models are based on the architecture described in [Revisiting ResNets: Improved Training and Scaling Strategies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07579.pdf)\r\n    *   Added `tf.keras.optimizers.experimental.Optimizer`. The reworked optimizer gives more control over different phases of optimizer calls, and is easier to customize. We provide Adam, SGD, Adadelta, AdaGrad and RMSprop optimizers based on `tf.keras.optimizers.experimental.Optimizer`. Generally the new optimizers work in the same way as the old ones, but support new constructor arguments. In the future, the symbols `tf.keras.optimizers.Optimizer`/`Adam`/etc will point to the new optimizers, and the previous generation of optimizers will be moved to `tf.keras.optimizers.legacy.Optimizer`/`Adam`/etc.\r\n    *   Added L2 unit normalization layer `tf.keras.layers.UnitNormalization`.\r\n    *   Added `tf.keras.regularizers.OrthogonalRegularizer`, a new regularizer that encourages orthogonality between the rows (or columns) or a weight matrix.\r\n    *   Added `tf.keras.layers.RandomBrightness` layer for image preprocessing.\r\n    *   Added APIs for switching between interactive logging and absl logging. By default, Keras always writes the logs to stdout. However, this is not optimal in a non-interactive environment, where you don't have access to stdout, but can only view the logs. You can use `tf.keras.utils.disable_interactive_logging()` to write the logs to ABSL logging. You can also use `tf.keras.utils.enable_interactive_logging()` to change it back to stdout, or `tf.keras.utils.is_interactive_logging_enabled()` to check if interactive logging is enabled.\r\n    *   Changed default value for the `verbose` argument of `Model.evaluate()` and `Model.predict()` to `\"auto\"`, which defaults to `verbose=1` for most cases and defaults to `verbose=2` when used with `ParameterServerStrategy` or with interactive logging disabled.\r\n    *   Argument `jit_compile` in `Model.compile()` now applies to `Model.evaluate()` and `Model.predict()`. Setting `jit_compile=True` in `compile()` compiles the model's training, evaluation, and inference steps to [XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla). Note that `jit_compile=True` may not necessarily work for all models.\r\n    *   Added DTensor-related Keras APIs under `tf.keras.dtensor` namespace. The APIs are still classified as experimental. You are welcome to try it out. Please check the tutoral and guide on https://www.tensorflow.org/ for more details about DTensor.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Update_OptimizerV2.py by @sachinprasadhs in

{"name": "qlzh727", "type": "User"}, "description": "Please see https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r2.8/RELEASE.md for Keras release notes.\r\n\r\n* `tf.keras`:\r\n  * Preprocessing Layers\r\n    * Added a `tf.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing.HashedCrossing`\r\n      layer which applies the hashing trick to the concatenation of crossed\r\n      scalar inputs. This provides a stateless way to try adding feature crosses\r\n      of integer or string data to a model.\r\n    * Removed `keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing.CategoryCrossing`. Users\r\n      should migrate to the `HashedCrossing` layer or use\r\n      `tf.sparse.cross`/`tf.ragged.cross` directly.\r\n    * Added additional `standardize` and `split` modes to `TextVectorization`.\r\n        * `standardize=\"lower\"` will lowercase inputs.\r\n        * `standardize=\"string_punctuation\"` will remove all puncuation.\r\n        * `split=\"character\"` will split on every unicode character.\r\n    * Added an `output_mode` argument to the `Discretization` and `Hashing`\r\n      layers with the same semantics as other preprocessing layers. All\r\n      categorical preprocessing layers now support `output_mode`.\r\n    * All preprocessing layer output will follow the compute dtype of a\r\n      `tf.keras.mixed_precision.Policy`, unless constructed with\r\n      `output_mode=\"int\"` in which case output will be `tf.int64`.\r\n      The output type of any preprocessing layer can be controlled individually\r\n      by passing a `dtype` argument to the layer.\r\n  * `tf.random.Generator` for keras initializers and all RNG code.\r\n    * Added 3 new APIs for enable/disable/check the usage of\r\n      `tf.random.Generator` in keras backend, which will be the new backend for\r\n      all the RNG in Keras. We plan to switch on the new code path by default in\r\n      tf 2.8, and the behavior change will likely to cause some breakage on user\r\n      side (eg if the test is checking against some golden nubmer). These 3 APIs\r\n      will allow user to disable and switch back to legacy behavior if they\r\n      prefer. In future (eg tf 2.10), we expect to totally remove the legacy\r\n      code path (stateful random Ops), and these 3 APIs will be removed as well.\r\n  * `tf.keras.callbacks.experimental.BackupAndRestore` is now available as\r\n    `tf.keras.callbacks.BackupAndRestore`. The experimental endpoint is\r\n    deprecated and will be removed in a future release.\r\n  * `tf.keras.experimental.SidecarEvaluator` is now available as\r\n    `tf.keras.utils.SidecarEvaluator`. The experimental endpoint is\r\n    deprecated and will be removed in a future release.\r\n  * Metrics update and collection logic in default `Model.train_step()` is now\r\n    customizable via overriding `Model.compute_metrics()`.\r\n  * Losses computation logic in default `Model.train_step()` is now\r\n    customizable via overriding `Model.compute_loss()`.\r\n  * `jit_compile` added to `Model.compile()` on an opt-in basis to compile the \r\n    model's training step with [XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla). Note that\r\n   `jit_compile=True` may not necessarily work for all models.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Cleanup legacy Keras files by @qlzh727 in

Open an issue\n\nBefore making any changes, we recommend opening an issue (if one doesn't already\nexist) and discussing your proposed changes. This way, we can give you feedback\nand validate the proposed changes.\n\nIf the changes are minor (simple bug fix or documentation fix), then feel free\nto open a PR without discussion.\n\n### Step 2. Make code changes\n\nTo make code changes, you need to fork the repository. You will need to setup a\ndevelopment environment and run the unit tests. This is covered in the section\n\"Setup environment\".\n\n### Step 3. Create a pull request\n\nOnce the change is ready, open a pull request from your branch in your fork to\nthe master branch in [keras-team/keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras).\n\n### Step 4. Sign the Contributor License Agreement\n\nAfter creating the pull request, the `cla/google` check will be performed and,\nif you haven't signed the Contributor License Agreement (CLA), it will fail with\ninstructions on how to do so. Please follow the instructions to sign the CLA and\nthe check will pass.\n\n![CLA signed](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/assets/1091026/71c26353-e3b5-4135-8bae-64693c717775)\n\n### Step 5. Code review\n\nIf the tests fail, look into the error messages and try to fix them.\n\n![CI tests](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/assets/1091026/6f6c17ef-6bd7-4e95-9fbc-1906cde37380)\n\nA reviewer will review the pull request and provide comments. There may be\nseveral rounds of comments and code changes before the pull request gets\napproved by the reviewer.\n\n![Approval from reviewer](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/assets/1091026/8d28f74c-21e9-4146-b0ff-62d649a552a8)\n\n### Step 6. Merging\n\nOnce the pull request is approved, a `ready to pull` tag will be added to the\npull request. A team member will take care of the merging.\n\n![Ready to pull and merged](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/assets/1091026/c3908345-d7ae-44ee-a428-01f3b448b46b)\n\nHere is an [example pull request](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/pull/18848)\nfor your reference.\n\n## Setup environment\n\nWe provide two ways of setting up a development environment. One is to use a\ndev container, and the other one is to setup a local environment by installing\nthe dev tools needed.\n\n### Option 1: GitHub Codespace or dev container\n\nWe support GitHub Codespaces, Visual Studio Code dev containers and JetBrain dev\ncontainers. Please see the\n[Dev container documentation](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/tree/master/.devcontainer).\n\n### Option 2: Setup a local environment\n\nTo setup your local dev environment, you will need the following tools.\n\n1.  [git](https://github.com/) for code repository management.\n2.  [python](https://www.python.org/) to build and code in Keras.\n\nThe following commands check the tools above are successfully installed. Note\nthat Keras requires at least Python 3.9 to run.\n\n```shell\ngit --version\npython --version\n```\n\nClone your forked repo to your local machine. Go to the cloned directory to\ninstall the dependencies.\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/keras.git\ncd keras\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nYou then need to configure the backend to use, see the\n[Configuring your backend](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/README.md#configuring-your-backend)\nsection of the README.\n\nYou can also add GPU support to your environment, see the\n[Adding GPU support](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/README.md#adding-gpu-support)\nsection of the README.\n\n## Code style\n\nThe Keras uses [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and\n[isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) to format the code. Please refer to\n[requirements-common.txt](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/requirements-common.txt)\nfor the required versions. Run the following command **at the root directory of\nthe repo** to format your code.\n\n```\nsh shell/format.sh\n```\n\nIt will also display the errors that cannot be resolved by autoformatting. You\nneed to follow the output of the command to resolve them manually.\n\nIf you do not want to auto format the code but only show the lint errors, you\ncan run `sh shell/lint.sh` **at the root directory of the repo**.\n\n### Docstrings\n\nWe do not have an automated way to check docstring style, so if you write\nor edit any docstring, please make sure to check them manually.\nKeras docstrings follow the conventions below:\n\nA **class docstring** may contain the following items:\n\n* A one-line description of the class.\n* Paragraph(s) of more detailed information.\n* Optional `Examples` section.\n* `Args` section for arguments in `__init__()`.\n* If it's a layer:\n    * `Call arguments` section for arguments in `Layer.call()`.\n    * `Returns` section for the return values of `Layer.call()`.\n    * Optional `Raises` section for possible errors.\n\nYou can check out `MultiHeadAttention` as an example\n[(link)](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/v3.0.0/keras/layers/attention/multi_head_attention.py#L20).\n\nA **function docstring** may contain the following items:\n\n* One-line description of the function.\n* Paragraph(s) of more detailed information.\n* Optional `Examples` section.\n* `Args` section for the function arguments.\n* `Returns` section for the return values.\n* Optional `Raises` section for possible errors.\n\nYou can check out `text_dataset_from_directory` as an example\n[(link)](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/v3.0.0/keras/utils/text_dataset_utils.py#L27).\n\n## Run tests\n\nWe use [pytest](https://pytest.org/) to run the tests.\n\n### Run a test file\n\nTo run the tests in `pytest keras/losses/losses_test.py`, use following command\nat the root directory of the repo.\n\n```shell\npytest pytest keras/losses/losses_test.py\n```\n\n### Run a single test case\n\nYou can specify a single test class to run within a file.\n\n```shell\npytest keras/losses/losses_test.py::MeanSquaredErrorTest\n```\n\nYou can also specify a single test method to run within a class.\n\n```shell\npytest keras/losses/losses_test.py::MeanSquaredErrorTest::test_sample_weighted\n```\n\n### Run all tests\n\nYou can run all the tests locally by running the following command in the repo\nroot directory.\n\n```shell\npytest keras\n```\n\nNote that you can skip the Keras applications tests using the\n`SKIP_APPLICATIONS_TESTS` environment variable. This will cut down the testing\ntime significantly.\n\n```shell\nSKIP_APPLICATIONS_TESTS=True pytest keras\n```\n\nTo run all tests using a different backend, you can simply specify it on the\ncommand line.\n\n```shell\nKERAS_BACKEND=jax SKIP_APPLICATIONS_TESTS=True pytest keras\n```\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fchollet/keras/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"}], "has_script_file": [{"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fchollet/keras/master/shell/lint.sh", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}, {"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fchollet/keras/master/shell/format.sh", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}, {"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fchollet/keras/master/.devcontainer/setup.sh", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}, {"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fchollet/keras/master/.kokoro/github/ubuntu/gpu/build.sh", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}], "installation": [{"result": {"value": "Keras 3 is available on PyPI as `keras`.
