There is a specific focus on reinforcement learning with several contextual bandit algorithms implemented and the online nature lending to the problem well. Vowpal Wabbit is a destination for implementing and maturing state of the art algorithms with performance in mind. \n- **Input Format.** The input format for the learning algorithm is substantially more flexible than might be expected. Examples can have features consisting of free form text, which is interpreted in a bag-of-words way. There can even be multiple sets of free form text in different namespaces.\n- **Speed.** The learning algorithm is fast -- similar to the few other online algorithm implementations out there. There are several optimization algorithms available with the baseline being sparse gradient descent (GD) on a loss function.\n- **Scalability.** This is not the same as fast. Instead, the important characteristic here is that the memory footprint of the program is bounded independent of data. This means the training set is not loaded into main memory before learning starts. In addition, the size of the set of features is bounded independent of the amount of training data using the hashing trick.\n- **Feature Interaction.** Subsets of features can be internally paired so that the algorithm is linear in the cross-product of the subsets. This is useful for ranking problems. The alternative of explicitly expanding the features before feeding them into the learning algorithm can be both computation and space intensive, depending on how it's handled. \n", "original_header":

several new reductions including contextual bandits with graph feedback as well as a completely new interaction grounded learning reduction. There are also WASM bindings available for Vowpal Wabbit now.\r\n\r\n## Contextual Bandits with Graph Feedback\r\n\r\nContextual Bandits (CB) with graph feedback can be used for scenarios where some actions, when taken, reveal information other actions (not taken), or maybe don't reveal any information at all. If there exists prior knowledge of this relationship between actions then that knowledge can be used to make exploration and learning more efficient. \r\n\r\nSee [here](https://github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit/wiki/CB-with-Graph-Feedback) for more details.\r\n\r\n## Contextual Bandits with interaction grounded learning\r\n\r\nInteraction grounded learning (IGL) can be used for the scenario where user doesn't have a reward function. It will automatically learn a personalized reward function from user's feedback and optimize directly for the latent user satisfaction\r\n\r\nSee [here](https://github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit/wiki/Interaction-Grounded-Learning) for more details\r\n\r\n## Vowpal Wabbit package in npm\r\n\r\nNow that WASM bindings are available, Vowpal Wabbit can be used in JavaScript and TypeScript applications via the npm package.

EMTs will remember previous training examples and use this memory to assign labels to future requested predictions. For more information, see the [EMT wiki page](https://github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit/wiki/Eigen-Memory-Trees-(EMT))\r\n\r\n## Robust confidence sequence estimator\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit/pull/4297\r\n\r\n## Cubic config oracle in automl\r\n\r\nWe are now able to search over cubic interactions on top of quadratic interactions in automl . [Automl](https://github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit/wiki/Automl)\r\n\r\n## Vector CPU instructions\r\n\r\nVector CPU instructions for faster computation in the CB with Large Action Space reduction.  [LAS](https://github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit/wiki/Contextual-Bandits-with-Large-Action-Spaces-(LAS))\r\n\r\n## Predict only models\r\n\r\nAbility to save predict only models from some reductions (automl, epsilon-decay).\u00a0 this removes the reductions from the reduction stack and allows older versions of VW to predict.\r\n\r\n## Enforce minimum probability for SquareCB\r\n\r\n[SquareCB] (https://github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit/wiki/Contextual-Bandit-Exploration-with-SquareCB)\r\n\r\n## Support for probabilities for PLT\r\n\r\nAdded support for probabilities output for the PLT reduction + fix it in version 9+.\r\n\r\n## Target rate added to explore eval\r\n\r\nThe goal of explore eval is to evaluate different exploration algorithms using the data from a logged policy. [Explore Eval](https://github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit/wiki/Explore-Eval)\r\n\r\n## VW refactors\r\n\r\n- Improved finish_example in all reductions\r\n- Parsers for different formats moved into

Spaces\r\nThis introduces the Large Actions Spaces (LAS) feature. LAS is an algorithm that lets exploration happen efficiently when there are a large number of actions in a contextual bandit dataset. The main idea behind it is to eliminate actions that are similar and explore only over the most diverse actions in the dataset. For more information, see the [LAS wiki page](https://github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit/wiki/Contextual-Bandits-with-Large-Action-Spaces-(LAS)).\r\n\r\n## Style Changes\r\nThis release introduces additional style changes to make VW code formatting more consistent. Variable and type names are `snake_case`, constants and macros are `UPPERCASE`, and the `VW::details` namespace is used to hide implementation details.\r\n\r\n## Faster Compile Times\r\nThrough @jackgerrits's changes to some header files, VW now builds much faster! On one machine, compile times went from around 30 seconds to 17.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Click here to see all changes in this release</summary>\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* build: remove

The contents of these release notes and all associated artifacts correspond to the `9.4.0` tag on September 15.\r\n\r\n## DotNet Core\r\n\r\nDotNet core support is here! It works if you [manually import dependencies](https://github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit/issues/4214), but it will become automatic in the upcoming `9.4.1`.\r\n\r\n## Native CSV Parser\r\n\r\nAs part of RLOS Fest this year @HollowMan6 implemented Native CSV parsing support. It is currently disabled by default but is available using a CMake option (`VW_BUILD_CSV`). This feature makes it possible to download CSV datasets and process them without any extra steps. @HollowMan6 also created a [tutorial](\r\nhttps://vowpalwabbit.org/docs/vowpal_wabbit/python/latest/tutorials/cmd_csv_with_iris_dataset.html) to explain how to use the feature on the well known iris dataset.

If it's\nsomething non trivial we suggest reaching out to make sure it aligns with the\nproject goals (performance implications, design requirements, interfaces, etc.).\nThis will let us have a brief discussion about the problem and, hopefully,\nidentify some potential pitfalls before too much time is spent on your part.\n\nIf you're just fixing typos or small bugs there's no need to reach out\nbeforehand.\n\n### Implementation\n\n* Fork the repository on GitHub\n* Start on a new topic branch off of master\n* Instructions for getting Vowpal Wabbit building and running the tests are in the\n  [Wiki](https://github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit/wiki)\n* Aim for each pull request to have one goal. If the PR starts to get too large,\n  consider splitting it into multiple, independent pull requests\n    * Some changes are more naturally authored in the same pull request. This is\n      fine, though we find this to be a rare occurrence. These sort of changes\n      are harder to review\n* Aim to add tests that exercise the new behaviour and make sure that all the\n  tests continue to pass\n\n### Pull request\n\nStart a GitHub pull request to merge your topic branch into the [main repository's master branch](https://github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit/tree/master).\n\nWhen you submit a pull request, a suite of builds and tests will be run\nautomatically, and the results will show up in the \"Checks\" section of the PR.\nGenerally, we'll wait for these to all pass before we review your PR. If you\nneed help resolving build or test issues feel free to reach out in the comments\nof your PR.\n\nWe suggest ticking \"Allow edits and access to secrets by maintainers\" so that we\ncan contribute to your PR if need be.\n\n### Merge\n\nOnce the comments in the pull request have been addressed, we will merge your\nchanges. Thank you for helping improve Vowpal Wabbit!\n\nBy default we'll perform a squash merge, so don't worry if the commit history is\nmessy.\n\n# Reporting Security Issues\n\nSecurity issues and bugs should be reported privately, via email, to `vowpalwabbit-security [a t] hunch.net`\n# Contact us\n\nWays to get in contact can be found [here](https://github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit/issues/new/choose).\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nAlthough VW is not a Microsoft project, we follow the \n[Microsoft Open Source Code of
