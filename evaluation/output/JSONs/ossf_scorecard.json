"laurentsimon", "type": "User"}, "description": "## Description\r\nThis release of Scorecard provides bug fixes, enhancements and new features, including many changes that are not compatible with earlier versions of Scorecard. The project remains available via a [docker image](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/tree/v3.0.0#docker).\r\n\r\n## Release Notes\r\n\r\n### API changes\r\nWe are experimenting with new APIs based on user feedback to improve clarity and usability. Please try them out and leave us feedback on the scorecard repository!\r\n\r\n### New code features and enhancements\r\n- Numeric scoring and risk categories replace Pass/Fail.\r\n- Aggregated score.\r\n- [Improved JSON](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/v3.0.0/pkg/json.v2.schema) output (`--format json | jq`).\r\n- New [repo interface](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/v3.0.0/clients/repo_client.go) to simplify the future integration of other code versioning systems besides GitHub.\r\n- Use GitHub v4 (GraphQL) APIs instead of REST API to improve performance and efficiency. \r\n- Improved documentation ([checks](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/v3.0.0/docs/checks.md) and main [README](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/v3.0.0/README.md)).\r\n### Removal\r\n- Support for CSV format has been removed. Please use the [JSON format](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/v3.0.0/pkg/json.v2.schema) to upgrade.\r\n\r\n### Scaling\r\n- Weekly scans for 200k GitHub repos with critical ecosystems dependencies from [deps.dev](https://deps.dev).\r\n- Weekly scan results are available in a [BigQuery table](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/tree/v3.0.0#public-data) in the [new JSON format](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/v3.0.0/cron/format/json.v2.schema).\r\n\r\n### LTS\r\n- Weekly scans that output the older JSON format will continue until 31 March 2022. \r\n- Weekly scans that output the [new JSON format](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/v3.0.0/cron/format/json.v2.schema) will be available at least until the end of 2022.\r\n\r\n### Huge thanks to all

will take appropriate and fair corrective action in\nresponse to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,\nor harmful.\n\nCommunity leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject\ncomments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are\nnot aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation\ndecisions when appropriate.\n\n## Scope\n\nThis Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when\nan individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.\nExamples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,\nposting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed\nrepresentative at an online or offline event.\n\n## Enforcement\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be\nreported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at\nconduct@openssf.org.\nAll complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.\n\nAll community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the\nreporter of any incident.\n\n## Enforcement Guidelines\n\nCommunity

Create [a GitHub account](https://github.com/join)\n1.  Create a\n    [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/developers/apps/about-apps#personal-access-tokens)\n1.  Set up your [development environment](#environment-setup)\n\n### Environment Setup\n\nYou must install these tools:\n\n1.  [`git`](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/): For source control\n\n1.  [`go`](https://golang.org/doc/install): You need go version\n    [v1.21](https://golang.org/dl/) or higher.\n\n1.  [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/): `v18.9` or higher.\n\n## Contributing steps\n\n1.  Submit an issue describing your proposed change to the repo in question.\n1.  The repo owners will respond to your issue promptly.\n1.  Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.\n1.  Submit a pull request.\n\n## Error handling\n\nSee [errors](errors/errors.md).\n\n## How to build scorecard locally\n\nNote that, by building the scorecard from the source code we are allowed to test\nthe changes made locally.\n\n1.  Run the following command to clone your fork of the project locally\n\n```shell\ngit clone git@github.com:<user>/scorecard.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/<user>/scorecard.git\n```\n\n1.  Enter the project folder by running the command `cd ./scorecard`\n1.  Ensure you activate module support before continue (`$ export\n    GO111MODULE=on`)\n1.  Install the build tools for the project by running the command `make install`\n1.  Run the command `make build` to build the source code\n\n## How to run scorecard locally\n\nIn the project folder, run the following command:\n\n```shell\n// Get scores for a repository\n$ go run main.go --repo=github.com/ossf-tests/scorecard-check-branch-protection-e2e\n```\n\nYou can input the repository you want to analyze using the `--repo=<your_repo>` flag. To view more Scorecard commands run:\n\n```shell\n// View scorecard help\n$ go run main.go --help\n```\n\n### Choosing checks to run\n\nYou can use the `--checks` option to select which checks to run.\nThis is useful if, for example, you only want to run the check you're\ncurrently developing.\n\n```shell\n// Get score for Pinned-Dependencies check\n$ go run main.go --repo=github.com/ossf-tests/scorecard-check-branch-protection-e2e --checks=Pinned-Dependencies\n\n// Get score for Pinned-Dependencies and Binary-Artifacts check\n$ go run main.go --repo=github.com/ossf-tests/scorecard-check-branch-protection-e2e --checks=Pinned-Dependencies,Binary-Artifacts\n```\n\n## PR Process\n\nEvery PR should be annotated with an icon indicating whether it's a:\n\n-   Breaking change: :warning: (`:warning:`)\n-   Non-breaking feature: :sparkles: (`:sparkles:`)\n-   Patch fix: :bug: (`:bug:`)\n-   Docs: :book: (`:book:`)\n-   Infra/Tests/Other: :seedling: (`:seedling:`)\n-   No release note: :ghost: (`:ghost:`)\n\nUse :ghost: (no release note) only for the PRs that change or revert unreleased\nchanges, which don't deserve a release note. Please don't abuse it.\n\nYou are free to use the `:xyz:` aliases or to use the equivalent emoji directly.\n\nIndividual commits should not be tagged separately, but will generally be\nassumed to match the PR. For instance, if you have a bugfix in with a breaking\nchange, it's generally encouraged to submit the bugfix separately, but if you\nmust put them in one PR, you should mark the whole PR as breaking.\n\n## What to do before submitting a pull request\n\nFollowing the targets that can be used to test your changes locally.\n\n| Command  | Description                                        | Is called in the CI? |\n| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |\n| make all | Runs go test,golangci lint checks, fmt, go mod tidy| yes                  |\n| make e2e-pat | Runs e2e tests                                     | yes                  |\n\nMake sure to signoff your commits before submitting a pull request.\n\nhttps://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/github/how-to-signoff/\n\n## Permission for GitHub personal access tokens\n\nThe personal access token need the following scopes:\n\n-   `repo:status` - Access commit status\n-   `repo_deployment` - Access deployment status\n-   `public_repo` - Access public repositories\n\n## Where the CI Tests are configured\n\n1.  See the [action files](.github/workflows) to check its tests, and the\n    scripts used on it.\n\n## How do I add additional GitHub repositories to be scanned by scorecard weekly?\n\nScorecard maintains the list of repositories in a file\nhttps://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/cron/internal/data/projects.csv\n\nSubmit a PR for this file and scorecard would start scanning in subsequent runs.\n\n## Adding New Checks\n\nSee [checks/write.md](checks/write.md).\nWhen you add new checks, you need to also update the docs.\n\n## Updating Docs\n\nA summary for each check needs to be included in the `README.md`.\nIn most cases, to update the documentation simply edit the corresponding\n`.md` file, with the notable exception of the auto-generated file `checks.md`.\n\nDetails about each check need to be  provided in\n[docs/checks/internal/checks.yaml](docs/checks/internal/checks.yaml).\nIf you want to update its documentation, update that `checks.yaml` file.\n\nWhenever you modify the `checks.yaml` file, run the following to\ngenerate `docs/checks.md`:\n\n~~~~\nmake generate-docs\n~~~~\n\n**DO NOT** edit `docs/checks.md` directly, as that is an\nauto-generated file. Edit `docs/checks/internal/checks.yaml` instead.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ossf/scorecard/main/CONTRIBUTING.md"}, {"result": {"value": "Before contributing, please follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\nSee the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) documentation for guidance on how to\ncontribute to the project.\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Contribute to Scorecard", "parent_header": ["OpenSSF Scorecard", "Contribute"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ossf/scorecard/main/README.md"}, {"result": {"value": "If you'd like to add a check, please see guidance [here](checks/write.md).\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Adding a Scorecard Check", "parent_header": ["OpenSSF Scorecard", "Contribute"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ossf/scorecard/main/README.md"}, {"result": {"value": "If you want to get involved in the Scorecard community or have ideas you'd like\nto chat about, we discuss this project in the\n[OSSF Best Practices Working Group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers)\nmeetings.\n\nArtifact                      | Link\n----------------------------- | ----\nScorecard Dev Forum           | [ossf-scorecard-dev@](https://groups.google.com/g/ossf-scorecard-dev)\nScorecard Announcements Forum | [ossf-scorecard-announce@](https://groups.google.com/g/ossf-scorecard-announce)\nCommunity Meeting VC          | [Link to z o o m meeting](https://zoom.us/j/98835923979)\nCommunity Meeting Calendar    | Biweekly Thursdays, 1:00pm-2:00pm PST <br>[Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=czYzdm9lZmhwNWk5cGZsdGI1cTY3bmdwZXNAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ)\nMeeting Notes                 | [Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dB2U7_qZpNW96vtuoG7ShmgKXzIg6R5XT5Tc-0yz6kE/edit#heading=h.4k8ml0qkh7tl)\nSlack Channel                 | [#security_scorecards](https://slack.openssf.org/#security_scorecards)\n\n__Maintainers__ are listed in the [CODEOWNERS file](.github/CODEOWNERS).\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Connect with the Scorecard Community", "parent_header": ["OpenSSF Scorecard", "Contribute"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ossf/scorecard/main/README.md"}, {"result": {"value": "We meet every other Thursday -
