Users who want to benefit from it can migrate to this version first, fix their code until there are no more warnings, and then they'll be ready to use v3 proper.

Users should from now on pass Neff, the effective number of relativistic neutrino species in the early universe, and mnu, either a sum or neutrino masses or a set of 3 neutrinos masses.\r\n\r\n## C library\r\nIn ccl_core.c:\r\n\r\nIn the function, 'ccl\\_parameters\\_create', the arguements 'double N\\_nu\\_rel', and 'double N\\_nu\\_mass' have been removed. The arguments 'double Neff' and 'ccl\\_mnu\\_convention mnu\\_type' have been added. The argument 'mnu' has changed in type from 'double mnu' to 'double* mnu'.\r\n\r\nSimilar changes apply in 'ccl\\_cosmology\\_create\\_with\\_params' and all 'ccl\\_parameters\\_create...nu' convenience functions.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in the function 'ccl\\_parameters\\_create' and 'ccl\\_cosmology\\_create\\_with\\_params', arguments have been added for the parameters of the BCM baryon model; these are 'double bcm\\_log10Mc', 'double bcm\\_etab', and 'double bcm\\_ks'.\r\n\r\nIn ccl_neutrinos.c:\r\n\r\nThe function ccl\\_Omeganuh2\\_to\\_Mnu has been renamed ccl\\_nu\\_masses. The arguments 'double a' and 'gsl\\_interp\\_accel* accel' have been removed. The argument 'ccl\\_neutrino\\_mass\\_splits mass\\_split' has been added.\r\n\r\n## Python wrapper\r\nIn core.py:\r\n\r\nIn the Parameters class, the arguments 'N\\_nu\\_rel', and 'N\\_nu\\_mass' have been removed. The optional arguments 'Neff', 'mnu\\_type', 'bcm\\_log10Mc', 'bcm\\_etab', and 'bcm\\_ks' have been added. Similar changes occur in the Cosmology class. \r\n\r\nIn neutrinos.py:\r\n\r\nIn the function Omeganuh2, the argument 'Neff' has been removed. It is now fixed to the length of the argument 'mnu'.\r\nThe function 'Omeganuh2\\_to\\_Mnu' has been renamed 'nu\\_masses'. The arguments 'a' and 'Neff' have been removed. The argument 'mass\\_split' has been added.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other changes since release 0.2.1 (September 2017):\r\n\r\nCLASS is no longer included as part of CCL; it can instead of easily downloaded via the class_install.py script and this procedure is documented.\r\n\r\nTutorial added for usage with MCMC\r\n\r\nAdded support for BCM baryon model\r\n\r\ncpp compatibility improved\r\n\r\nPython 3 support added\r\n\r\nAdded support for computing the nonlinear matter power spectrum with CosmicEmu\r\n\r\nAdded support for CMB lensing observables, including splines for cosmological quantities to higher redshift\r\n\r\nAdded the ability to return useful functions such as dNdz for a tracer Cl object.\r\n\r\nClarified license", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LSSTDESC/CCL/tarball/v0.3", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LSSTDESC/CCL/zipball/v0.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CCL/releases/tag/v0.3", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LSSTDESC/CCL/releases/10503096", "release_id": 10503096, "date_created": "2018-04-11T19:23:03Z", "date_published": "2018-04-11T19:32:32Z"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/LSSTDESC/CCL/releases/7640003", "tag": "0.2.1", "name": "CCL v 0.2.1", "author": {"name": "fjaviersanchez", "type": "User"}, "description": "* Includes Travis support\r\n* `setup.py` now installs also the C libraries\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LSSTDESC/CCL/tarball/0.2.1", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LSSTDESC/CCL/zipball/0.2.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CCL/releases/tag/0.2.1", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LSSTDESC/CCL/releases/7640003", "release_id": 7640003, "date_created": "2017-09-05T13:38:15Z", "date_published": "2017-09-05T15:44:01Z"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/LSSTDESC/CCL/releases/6999481", "tag": "0.2", "name": "CCL v0.2", "author": {"name": "elisachisari", "type": "User"}, "description": "This version of CCL (v0.2) marks the first public release of the library.
