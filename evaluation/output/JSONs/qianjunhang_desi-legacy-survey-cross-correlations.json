(2020) selected by magnitude limits g<24, r<22, w1<19.5 is also provided.\n\nFor photo-z calibration we have used the following surveys: GAMA (DR2; Liske et al. 2015), BOSS (DR12; Alamet al. 2015), eBOSS (DR16; Ahumada et al. 2020), VIPERS (DR2; Scodeggio et al. 2018), and DEEP2 (Newman et al. 2013).

We used a smoothed version of the original map, which can be generated from: https://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/allsky.

Galaxy biases are fitted in the galaxy auto-correlation part, follwing the 2-bias model treatment in [Hang et. al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00466). The code also fits a second order polynomial for the bias evolution for calculating the unbinned case. Alternatively you can supply your own b(z) in this step. These bias evolution curves are then fixed for the cross-correlation analysis.\n    - The likelihood of $`A_{\\kappa}`$ and $`A_{ISW}`$ is then computed from the ratio of data and theory (with the same galaxy bias) using the diagonal covariance.\n* Cosmological interpretation\n    - We first obtain dependence of $`A_{\\kappa}`$ on cosmological parameter given our unbinned n(z). This is done by varying one parameter at a time using CAMB, and measure the dependence of $`C_{\\ell}^{\\delta k}`$ on these parameters. We find that it is proportional to the combination $`\\sigma_8 \\Omega_m^{0.78}`$.\n    - We then use [functions/cosmology_interpretation.py](https://gitlab.com/qianjunhang/desi-legacy-survey-cross-correlations/-/blob/master/functions/cosmology_interpretation.py) to make the final cosmological interpretation plot.\n\n    ![Final Constraints on \\\\( \\Omega_m \\\\) and \\\\( \\sigma_8 \\\\)](data/omsigma8.png)\n\nIf you use the code or data products on this site, please cite [Hang et. al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00466).\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "You can directly use the density map (\"data/galmap_final-bin[0/1/2/3].fits\") along with the final mask (\"data/Legacy_footprint_final_mask.fits\") if needed and skip all the step before", "parent_header": ["CMB lensing and ISW cross-correlation with Legacy Survey", "Steps for the full analysis"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://gitlab.com/qianjunhang/desi-legacy-survey-cross-correlations/-/blob/master/README.md"}], "description": [{"result": {"type": "Text_excerpt", "value": "Along with all the codes we also provide a cleaned and systematic corrected density maps in tomographic bin which one can use for further analysis without needing to worry about phot-z details or download the full catalogue.
