The idea of this library is to provide a simple way of applying beamforming for \nsource separation and/or speech enhancement directly to multi-channel microphone recordings store as numpy arrays. \nFor most of the beamformers the only information needed is the microphone recordings of the mixture \n(or the noisy speech) and a segment of recordings of the noise alone. No need to provide the steering vector as \nit is automatically extracted from the data (see docs for more information on how this works). If available, \nrecordings of the target speech alone will help the estimate of the steering vector providing a cleaner output. \nNow with also mask-based beamformers!
