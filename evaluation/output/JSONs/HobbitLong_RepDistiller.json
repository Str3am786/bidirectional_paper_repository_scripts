Fetch the pretrained teacher models by:\n\n    ```\n    sh scripts/fetch_pretrained_teachers.sh\n    ```\n   which will download and save the models to `save/models`\n   \n2. Run distillation by following commands in `scripts/run_cifar_distill.sh`. An example of running Geoffrey's original Knowledge Distillation (KD) is given by:\n\n    ```\n    python train_student.py --path_t ./save/models/resnet32x4_vanilla/ckpt_epoch_240.pth --distill kd --model_s resnet8x4 -r 0.1 -a 0.9 -b 0 --trial 1\n    ```\n    where the flags are explained as:\n    - `--path_t`: specify the path of the teacher model\n    - `--model_s`: specify the student model, see 'models/\\_\\_init\\_\\_.py' to check the available model types.\n    - `--distill`: specify the distillation method\n    - `-r`: the weight of the cross-entropy loss between logit and ground truth, default: `1`\n    - `-a`: the weight of the KD loss, default: `None`\n    - `-b`: the weight of other distillation losses, default: `None`\n    - `--trial`: specify the experimental id to differentiate between multiple runs.\n    \n    Therefore, the command for running CRD is something like:\n    ```\n    python train_student.py --path_t ./save/models/resnet32x4_vanilla/ckpt_epoch_240.pth --distill crd --model_s resnet8x4 -a 0 -b 0.8 --trial 1\n    ```\n    \n3. Combining a distillation objective with KD is simply done by setting `-a` as a non-zero value, which results in the following example (combining CRD with KD)\n    ```\n    python train_student.py --path_t ./save/models/resnet32x4_vanilla/ckpt_epoch_240.pth --distill crd --model_s resnet8x4 -a 1 -b 0.8 --trial 1     \n    ```\n\n4. (optional) Train teacher networks from scratch. Example commands are in `scripts/run_cifar_vanilla.sh`\n\nNote: the default setting is for a single-GPU training. If you would like to play this repo with multiple GPUs, you might need to tune the learning rate, which empirically needs to be scaled up linearly with the batch size, see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02677)\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Running", "parent_header": ["RepDistiller"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HobbitLong/RepDistiller/master/README.md"}], "citation": [{"result": {"value": "If you find this repo useful for your research, please consider citing the paper\n\n```\n@inproceedings{tian2019crd,\n  title={Contrastive Representation Distillation},\n  author={Yonglong Tian and Dilip Krishnan and Phillip Isola},\n  booktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\n  year={2020}\n}\n```\nFor any questions, please contact Yonglong Tian (yonglong@mit.edu).\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Citation", "parent_header": ["RepDistiller"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HobbitLong/RepDistiller/master/README.md"}, {"result": {"value": "@inproceedings{tian2019crd,\n  title={Contrastive Representation Distillation},\n  author={Yonglong Tian and Dilip Krishnan and Phillip Isola},\n  booktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\n  year={2020}\n}", "type": "Text_excerpt", "format": "bibtex"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HobbitLong/RepDistiller/master/README.md"}], "acknowledgement": [{"result": {"value": "Thanks to Baoyun Peng for providing the code of CC and to Frederick Tung for verifying our reimplementation of SP.
