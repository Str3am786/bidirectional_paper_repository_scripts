Note this doesn't run the Python code from `to_save`\n# but instead uses the TensorFlow Graph that is part of the saved model.\nloaded.inference(tf.ones([1, input_size]))\n\n# The all_variables property can be used to retrieve the restored variables.\nassert len(loaded.all_variables) > 0\n```\n \nNote that the loaded object is not a Sonnet module, it is a container object\nthat has the specific methods (e.g. `inference`) and properties (e.g.\n`all_variables`) that we added in the previous block.\n \n", "original_header": "TensorFlow Saved Model"}, "confidence": 0.9665410464316699, "technique": "supervised_classification", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepmind/sonnet/v2/README.md"}, {"result": {"type": "Text_excerpt", "value": "A key difference between Sonnet and distributed training using `tf.keras` is\nthat Sonnet modules and optimizers do not behave differently when run under\ndistribution strategies (e.g. we do not average your gradients or sync your\nbatch norm stats).
