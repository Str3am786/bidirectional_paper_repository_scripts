In this formulation, the drift of the optimally controlled process is chosen to match the distribution of paths in the Feynman-Kac (FK) representation of the solution of the imaginary time Schr\u00f6dinger equation. This provides a variational principle that can be used for reinforcement learning of a neural representation of the drift. Our approach is a drop-in replacement for path integral Monte Carlo, learning an optimal importance sampler for the FK trajectories. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach to several problems of one-, two-, and many-particle physics. \n", "original_header": "Abstract"}, "confidence": 0.9980050582985139, "technique": "supervised_classification", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AustenLamacraft/QuaRL/master/README.md"}, {"result": {"type": "Text_excerpt", "value": "All our models are implemented using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [Pytorch Lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning).
