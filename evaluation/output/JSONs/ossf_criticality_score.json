Also, higher susceptibility to vulnerabilities.\n| recent_releases_count | 0.5 | 26 | Number of releases in the last year | Frequent releases indicates user dependency. Lower weight since this is not always used. |\n| closed_issues_count | 0.5 | 5000 | Number of issues closed in the last 90 days | Indicates high contributor involvement and focus on closing user issues. Lower weight since it is dependent on project contributors. |\n| updated_issues_count | 0.5 | 5000 | Number of issues updated in the last 90 days | Indicates high contributor involvement. Lower weight since it is dependent on project contributors. |\n| comment_frequency | 1 | 15 | Average number of comments per issue in the last 90 days | Indicates high user activity and dependence. |\n| **dependents_count** | **2** | 500000 | Number of project mentions in the commit messages | Indicates repository use, usually in version rolls.

This document describes the contribution guidelines for the project.\n\n**Note:** Before you start contributing, you must read and abide by our\n**[Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**.\n\n## Contributing code\n\n### Getting started\n\n1.  Create [a GitHub account](https://github.com/join)\n1.  Create a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/developers/apps/about-apps#personal-access-tokens)\n1.  (Optionally) a Google Cloud Platform account for [deps.dev](https://deps.dev) data\n1.  Set up your [development environment](#environment-setup)\n\nThen you can [iterate](#iterating).\n\n## Environment Setup\n\nYou must install these tools:\n\n1.  [`git`](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/): For source control.\n\n1.  [`go`](https://go.dev/dl/): For running code.\n\nAnd optionally:\n\n1.  [`gcloud`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install): For Google Cloud Platform access for deps.dev data.\n\nThen clone the repository, e.g:\n\n```shell\n$ git clone git@github.com:ossf/criticality_score.git\n$ cd criticality_score\n```\n\n## Iterating\n\n1. Find or create an [issue](https://github.com/ossf/criticality_score/issues)\n\n1. Make code changes to:\n    - the [collect_signals CLI tool](https://github.com/ossf/criticality_score/tree/main/cmd/collect_signals)\n    - the [GitHub enumerator](https://github.com/ossf/criticality_score/tree/main/cmd/enumerate_github)\n    - the [signal collector worker](https://github.com/ossf/criticality_score/tree/main/cmd/collect_signals)\n    - the [scorer](https://github.com/ossf/criticality_score/tree/main/cmd/scorer)\n    - the scorer [algorithm configuration](https://github.com/ossf/criticality_score/tree/main/config/scorer)\n\n1. Run your changes. For example, for a single repository this can be done by\n   executing:\n\n```shell\n$ export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_x  # the personal access token created above\n$ go run ./cmd/criticality_score \\\n    -log=debug \\\n    -depsdev-disable \\  # remove if you have a GCP account configured\n    \"https://github.com/{ a repo }\"\n```\nNote: Each of the tools listed above can be run individually and has their own\nREADME.\n\n4. Ensure your code passes tests and lint checks:\n\n```shell\n$ make test\n$ make lint\n```\n\n5. Commit your change.
