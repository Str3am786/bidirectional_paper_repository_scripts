This paper characterizes state-of-the-art SLAM benchmarks 
and methods, with special attention on challenging 
benchmark properties and crucial components 
within the SLAM pipeline.  A decision tree is proposed 
to identify these properties and components.  By comparing the performance efficiency 
of SLAM systems on both normal speed and slo-mo playback, we are able 
to identify how SLAM implementations should be improved at the 
computational component level, and suggest where future research effort
should be dedicated to maximize impact.
