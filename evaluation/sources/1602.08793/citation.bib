abstract = {This paper deals with a nonparametric estimation of conditional quantile regression when the explanatory variable X takes its values in a bounded subspace of a functional space X and the response Y takes its values in a compact of the space Y R. The functional observations, X1,...,Xn, are projected onto a finite dimensional subspace having a suitable orthonormal system. The Xi's will be characterized by their coordinates in this basis. We perform the Support Vector Machine Quantile Regression approach in finite dimension with the selected coefficients. Then we establish weak consistency of this estimator. The various parameters needed for the construction of this estimator are automatically selected by data-splitting and by penalized empirical risk minimization. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Shi2021,
abstract = {The functional linear quantile regression model is widely used to characterize the relationship between a scalar response and a functional covariate. Most existing research results are based on a correct assumption that the response is related to the functional predictor through a linear model for given quantile levels. This paper focuses on investigating the adequacy check of the functional linear quantile regression model. We propose a nonparametric U-process test statistic based on the functional principal component analysis. It is proved that the test statistic follows a normal distribution asymptotically under the null hypothesis and diverges to infinity for any misspecified models. Therefore, the test is consistent against any fixed alternative. Moreover, it is shown that the test has asymptotic power one for the local alternative hypothetical models converging to the null hypothesis at the rates [Formula presented]. The finite sample properties of the test statistic are illustrated through extensive simulation studies. A real data set of 24 hourly measurements of ozone levels in Sacramento, California is analyzed by the proposed test.},

The estimator we are interested in, based on the Support Vector Machine method, was introduced in Crambes etal. (2011) [11]. We improve the results obtained in this former paper, giving a rate of convergence in probability of the estimator. In addition, we give a practical method to construct the estimator, solution of a penalized L1-type minimization problem, using an Iterative Reweighted Least Squares procedure. We evaluate the performance of the estimator in practice through simulations and a real data set study. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Yao2017a,
abstract = {We propose a regularized partially functional quantile regression model where the response variable is scalar while the explanatory variables involve both infinite-dimensional predictor processes viewed as functional data, and high-dimensional scalar covariates. Despite extensive work focusing on functional linear models, little effort has been devoted to the development of robust methodologies that tackle the scenarios of non-normal errors. This motivates our proposal of functional quantile regression that seeks an alternative and robust solution to least squares type procedures within the partially functional regression framework. We focus on estimating and selecting the important variables in the high-dimensional covariates, which is complicated by the infinite-dimensional functional predictor. We establish the asymptotic properties of the resulting shrinkage estimator, and empirical illustrations are given by simulation and an application to a brain imaging dataset.},

If one has complete measurements for each individual curve or, as is more common, one has measurements on a fine grid taken at the same time points for all curves, then many standard techniques may be applied. However, curves are often measured at an irregular and sparse set of time points which can differ widely across individuals. We present a technique for handling this more difficult case using a reduced rank mixed effects framework.},

The method is applicable when the individual curves are sampled at variable and irregularly spaced points. This produces a low-rank, low-frequency approximation to the covariance structure, which can be estimated naturally by the EM algorithm. Smooth curves for individual trajectories are constructed as best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) estimates, combining data from that individual and the entire collection. This framework leads naturally to methods for examining the effects of covariates on the shapes of the curves. We use model selection techniques-Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and cross-validation-to select the number of breakpoints for the spline approximation. We believe that the methodology we propose provides a simple, flexible, and computationally efficient means of functional data analysis.},

       abstract = {We propose a nonparametric method to perform functional principal components analysis for the case of sparse longitudinal data. The method aims at irregularly spaced longitudinal data, where the number of repeated measurements available per subject is small. In contrast, classical functional data analysis requires a large number of regularly spaced measurements per subject. We assume that the repeated measurements are located randomly with a random number of repetitions for each subject and are determined by an underlying smooth random (subject-specific) trajectory plus measurement errors. Basic elements of our approach are the parsimonious estimation of the covariance structure and mean function of the trajectories, and the estimation of the variance of the measurement errors. The eigenfunction basis is estimated from the data, and functional principal components score estimates are obtained by a conditioning step. This conditional estimation method is conceptually simple and straightforward to implement. A key step is the derivation of asymptotic consistency and distribution results under mild conditions, using tools from functional analysis. Functional data analysis for sparse longitudinal data enables prediction of individual smooth trajectories even if only one or few measurements are available for a subject. Asymptotic pointwise and simultaneous confidence bands are obtained for predicted individual trajectories, based on asymptotic distributions, for simultaneous bands under the assumption of a finite number of components. Model selection techniques, such as the Akaike information criterion, are used to choose the model dimension corresponding to the number of eigenfunctions in the model. The methods are illustrated with a simulation study, longitudinal CD4 data for a sample of AIDS patients, and time-course gene expression data for the yeast cell cycle.},

A more general analysis, based on the method of principal components, is also proposed that determines various alternative tracks or patterns that are most prevalent in the longitudinal blood pressure data. The degree of tracking along a constant percentile curve for systolic pressure was moderately high, as evidenced by a tracking index of .78 explaining 81% of the variance, but less strong for diastolic (tracking index of .60) where tracking along a percentile explained 66% of the variance. The value of the more general analysis of blood pressure patterns may lie in the assessment of adolescent risk factors for elevated adult blood pressure. Using adolescent patterns determined by either statistical model, adult systolic at age 38 was predicted (R2 = .22) by the concept of a systolic fixed percentile curve in adolescence, and similarly for diastolic (R2 = .21). However, the more general analysis based on longitudinal principal components further suggests that boys who have a larger than usual systolic peak at age 14 years, which is near the time of the adolescent physical growth spurt in these boys, may be more likely to have higher systolic pressures at age 38. Because the adult data were incomplete and highly unbalanced, these findings were obtained using random-effects models for longitudinal data.},

This method of cross-validation, which consists of deleting entire sample curves, has the advantage that it does not require that the covariance structure be known or estimated. In the estimation of the covariance structure, we are primarily concerned with models in which the first few eigenfunctions are smooth and the eigenvalues decay rapidly, so that the variability is predominantly of large scale. We propose smooth nonparametric estimates of the eigen-functions and a suitable method of cross-validation to determine the amount of smoothing. Our methods are applied to data on the gaits of a group of 5-year-old children.},

In two-stage models, the probability distributions for the response vectors of different individuals belong to a single family, but some random-effects parameters vary across individuals, with a distribution specified at the second stage. A general family of models is discussed, which includes both growth models and repeated-measures models as special cases. A unified approach to fitting these models, based on a combination of empirical Bayes and maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters and using the EM algorithm, is discussed. Two examples are taken from a current epidemiological study of the health effects of air pollution.},

       abstract = {We propose nonparametric methods for functional linear regression which are designed for sparse longitudinal data, where both the predictor and response are functions of a covariate such as time. Predictor and response processes have smooth random trajectories, and the data consist of a small number of noisy repeated measurements made at irregular times for a sample of subjects. In longitudinal studies, the number of repeated measurements per subject is often small and may be modeled as a discrete random number and, accordingly, only a finite and asymptotically nonincreasing number of measurements are available for each subject or experimental unit. We propose a functional regression approach for this situation, using functional principal component analysis, where we estimate the functional principal component scores through conditional expectations. This allows the prediction of an unobserved response trajectory from sparse measurements of a predictor trajectory. The resulting technique is flexible and allows for different patterns regarding the timing of the measurements obtained for predictor and response trajectories. Asymptotic properties for a sample of n subjects are investigated under mild conditions, as n → ∞, and we obtain consistent estimation for the regression function. Besides convergence results for the components of functional linear regression, such as the regression parameter function, we construct asymptotic pointwise confidence bands for the predicted trajectories. A functional coefficient of determination as a measure of the variance explained by the functional regression model is introduced, extending the standard R² to the functional case. The proposed methods are illustrated with a simulation study, longitudinal primary biliary liver cirrhosis data and an analysis of the longitudinal relationship between blood pressure and body mass index.},

       abstract = {We present the application of a nonparametric method to performing functional principal component analysis for functional curve data that consist of measurements of a random trajectory for a sample of subjects. This design typically consists of an irregular grid of time points on which repeated measurements are taken for a number of subjects. We introduce shrinkage estimates for the functional principal component scores that serve as the random effects in the model. Scatterplot smoothing methods are used to estimate the mean function and covariance surface of this model. We propose improved estimation in the neighborhood of and at the diagonal of the covariance surface, where the measurement errors are reflected. The presence of additive measurement errors motivates shrinkage estimates for the functional principal component scores. Shrinkage estimates are developed through best linear prediction and in a generalized version, aiming at minimizing one-curve-leave-out prediction error. The estimation of individual trajectories combines data obtained from that individual as well as all other individuals. We apply our methods to new data regarding the analysis of the level of $^{14}C-folate$ in plasma as a function of time since dosing of healthy adults with a small tracer dose of $^{14}C-folic$ acid. A time transformation was incorporated to handle design irregularity concerning the time points on which the measurements were taken. The proposed methodology, incorporating shrinkage and data-adaptive features, is seen to be well suited for describing population kinetics of $^{^14}C-folate-specific$ activity and random effects, and can also be applied to other functional data analysis problems.},

       abstract = {The use of principal component methods to analyze functional data is appropriate in a wide range of different settings. In studies of "functional data analysis," it has often been assumed that a sample of random functions is observed precisely, in the continuum and without noise. While this has been the traditional setting for functional data analysis, in the context of longitudinal data analysis a random function typically represents a patient, or subject, who is observed at only a small number of randomly distributed points, with nonnegligible measurement error. Nevertheless, essentially the same methods can be used in both these cases, as well as in the vast number of settings that lie between them. How is performance affected by the sampling plan? In this paper we answer that question. We show that if there is a sample of n functions, or subjects, then estimation of eigenvalues is a semiparametric problem, with root-n consistent estimators, even if only a few observations are made of each function, and if each observation is encumbered by noise. However, estimation of eigenfunctions becomes a nonparametric problem when observations are sparse. The optimal convergence rates in this case are those which pertain to more familiar function-estimation settings. We also describe the effects of sampling at regularly spaced points, as opposed to random points. In particular, it is shown that there are often advantages in sampling randomly. However, even in the case of noisy data there is a threshold sampling rate (depending on the number of functions treated) above which the rate of sampling (either randomly or regularly) has negligible impact on estimator performance, no matter whether eigenfunctions or eigenvectors are being estimated.},

  abstract ={Motivation: Temporal gene expression profiles provide an important characterization of gene function, as biological systems are predominantly developmental and dynamic. We propose a method of classifying collections of temporal gene expression curves in which individual expression profiles are modeled as independent realizations of a stochastic process. The method uses a recently developed functional logistic regression tool based on functional principal components, aimed at classifying gene expression curves into known gene groups. The number of eigenfunctions in the classifier can be chosen by leave-one-out cross-validation with the aim of minimizing the classification error.Results: We demonstrate that this methodology provides low-error-rate classification for both yeast cell-cycle gene expression profiles and Dictyostelium cell-type specific gene expression patterns. It also works well in simulations. We compare our functional principal components approach with a B-spline implementation of functional discriminant analysis for the yeast cell-cycle data and simulations. This indicates comparative advantages of our approach which uses fewer eigenfunctions/base functions. The proposed methodology is promising for the analysis of temporal gene expression data and beyond.Availability: MATLAB programs are available upon request.Contact: ileng@wfubmc.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary materials are available on the journal's website.},

The primary goal of SHHS is to study the association between sleep disrupted breathing (SDB) and adverse health effects. An exposure of primary interest is the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG), which was observed for thousands of individuals at two visits, roughly 5 years apart. This unique study design led to the development of models where the outcome, e.g. hypertension, is in an exponential family and the exposure, e.g. sleep EEG, is multilevel functional data. We show that GMFLMs are, in fact, generalized multilevel mixed effect models. Two consequences of this result are that: 1) the mixed effects inferential machinery can be used for GMFLM and 2) functional regression models can be extended naturally to include, for example, additional covariates, random effects and nonparametric components. We propose and compare two inferential methods based on the parsimonious decomposition of the functional space.},

The purpose of this paper is to predict a binary response variable in terms of a functional variable whose sample information is given by a set of curves measured without error. In order to solve this problem we formulate a functional logistic regression model and propose its estimation by approximating the sample paths in a finite dimensional space generated by a basis. Then, the problem is reduced to a multiple logistic regression model with highly correlated covariates. In order to reduce dimension and to avoid multicollinearity, two different approaches of functional principal component analysis of the sample paths are proposed. Finally, a simulation study for evaluating the estimating performance of the proposed principal component approaches is developed.",

In fact, these models generalize the whole family of generalized linear models η( x) = β' x, where η( x) = g(μ( x)) is some transformation of the regression function. We use the local scoring algorithm to estimate the functions f<sub>j</sub>(x<sub>j</sub>) nonparametrically, using a scatterplot smoother as a building block. We demonstrate the models in two different analyses: a nonparametric analysis of covariance and a logistic regression. The procedure can be used as a diagnostic tool for identifying parametric transformations of the covariates in a standard linear analysis. A variety of inferential tools have been developed to aid the analyst in assessing the relevance and significance of the estimated functions: these include confidence curves, degrees of freedom estimates, and approximate hypothesis tests. The local scoring algorithm is analogous to the iterative reweighted least squares algorithm for solving likelihood and nonlinear regression equations. At each iteration, an adjusted dependent variable is formed and an additive regression model is fit using the backfitting algorithm. The backfitting algorithm cycles through the variables and estimates each coordinated function by smoothing the partial residuals.},

       abstract = {We propose a generalized functional linear regression model for a regression situation where the response variable is a scalar and the predictor is a random function. A linear predictor is obtained by forming the scalar product of the predictor function with a smooth parameter function, and the expected value of the response is related to this linear predictor via a link function. If, in addition, a variance function is specified, this leads to a functional estimating equation which corresponds to maximizing a functional quasi-likelihood. This general approach includes the special cases of the functional linear model, as well as functional Poisson regression and functional binomial regression. The latter leads to procedures for classification and discrimination of stochastic processes and functional data. We also consider the situation where the link and variance functions are unknown and are estimated nonparametrically from the data, using a semiparametric quasi-likelihood procedure. An essential step in our proposal is dimension reduction by approximating the predictor processes with a truncated Karhunen-Loève expansion. We develop asymptotic inference for the proposed class of generalized regression models. In the proposed asymptotic approach, the truncation parameter increases with sample size, and a martingale central limit theorem is applied to establish the resulting increasing dimension asymptotics. We establish asymptotic normality for a properly scaled distance between estimated and true functions that corresponds to a suitable L2 metric and is defined through a generalized covariance operator. As a consequence, we obtain asymptotic tests and simultaneous confidence bands for the parameter function that determines the model. The proposed estimation, inference and classification procedures and variants with unknown link and variance functions are investigated in a simulation study. We find that the practical selection of the number of components works well with the AIC criterion, and this finding is supported by theoretical considerations. We include an application to the classification of medflies regarding their remaining longevity status, based on the observed initial egg-laying curve for each of 534 female medflies.},

Estimators are derived for several cases and some of their properties given. Estimation of the coefficients of a single equation in a simultaneous equations model is shown to be equivalent to estimation of linear functional relationships.},

       abstract = {Naively displaying a large collection of curves by superimposing them one on another all on the same graph is largely uninformative and aesthetically unappealing. We propose that a simple principal component analysis be used to identify important modes of variation among the curves and that principal component scores be used to identify particular curves which clearly demonstrate the form and extent of that variation. As a result, we obtain a small number of figures on which are plotted a very few "representative" curves from the original collection; these successfully convey the major information present in sets of "similar" curves in a clear and attractive manner. Useful adjunct displays, including the plotting of principal component scores against covariates, are also described. Two examples-one concerning a data-based bandwidth selection procedure for kernel density estimation, the other involving ozone level curve data-illustrate the ideas.},

A primary metric of the SHHS is the in-home polysomnogram, which includes two electroencephalographic (EEG) channels for each subject, at two visits. The volume and importance of this data presents enormous challenges for analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce multilevel functional principal component analysis (MFPCA), a novel statistical methodology designed to extract core intra- and inter-subject geometric components of multilevel functional data. Though motivated by the SHHS, the proposed methodology is generally applicable, with potential relevance to many modern scientific studies of hierarchical or longitudinal functional outcomes. Notably, using MFPCA, we identify and quantify associations between EEG activity during sleep and adverse cardiovascular outcomes.},

In particular, the approach can accommodate densely or sparsely sampled functional responses as well as multiple scalar and functional predictors. It also allows for the combination of continuous or categorical covariates. Tensor product B-spline basis is proposed for the estimation of the bivariate coefficient functions. We show that our estimators hold asymptotic consistency and normality. Several numerical examples demonstrate superior performance of the proposed methods against two existing approaches. The proposed method is also applied to a real data example.},

 abstract = {We propose a method of comparing two functional linear models in which explanatory variables are functions (curves) and responses can be either scalars or functions. In such models, the role of parameter vectors (or matrices) is played by integral operators acting on a function space. We test the null hypothesis that these operators are the same in two independent samples. The complexity of the test statistics increases as we move from scalar to functional responses and relax assumptions on the covariance structure of the regressors. They all, however, have an asymptotic chi-squared distribution with the number of degrees of freedom which depends on a specific setting. The test statistics are readily computable using the R package fda, and have good finite sample properties. The test is applied to egg-laying curves of Mediterranean flies and to data from terrestrial magnetic observatories. Nous proposons une méthode pour comparer deux modèles linéaires fonctionnels, pour lesquels les variables explicatives sont des fonctions (courbes) et les réponses sont ou bien des scalaires ou bien des fonctions. Pour ces modèles, le rôle des vecteurs ou des matrices de paramètres est joué par des opérateurs d'intégration sur un espace de fonctions. Nous testons l'hypothèse nulle que ces opérateurs sont les mêmes pour les deux échantillons indépendants. La complexité des statistiques de test s'accroit quand nous passons de réponses scalaires à des réponses fonctionnelles, et relachons les hypoth'eses sur la structure de covariance des régresseurs. Ces tests ont cependant une distribution asymptotique qui s uit une loi du Chi-deux, dont le nombre de degrés de liberté dépend d'un cadre particulier. Ces statistiques de test sont calculables avec le programme fda du logiciel R, et ont de bonnes propriétés en petit échantillon. La statistique de test est appliquée à des courbes de pontes de mouches Méditerranéennes, et à des données d'observatoires magnétiques terrestres.},

abstract = {Summary Functional data arise frequently in biomedical studies, where it is often of interest to investigate the association between functional predictors and a scalar response variable. While functional linear models (FLM) are widely used to address these questions, hypothesis testing for the functional association in the FLM framework remains challenging. A popular approach to testing the functional effects is through dimension reduction by functional principal component (PC) analysis. However, its power performance depends on the choice of the number of PCs, and is not systematically studied. In this article, we first investigate the power performance of the Wald-type test with varying thresholds in selecting the number of PCs for the functional covariates, and show that the power is sensitive to the choice of thresholds. To circumvent the issue, we propose a new method of ordering and selecting principal components to construct test statistics. The proposed method takes into account both the association with the response and the variation along each eigenfunction. We establish its theoretical properties and assess the finite sample properties through simulations. Our simulation results show that the proposed test is more robust against the choice of threshold while being as powerful as, and often more powerful than, the existing method. We then apply the proposed method to the cerebral white matter tracts data obtained from a diffusion tensor imaging tractography study.},
