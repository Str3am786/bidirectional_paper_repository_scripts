A discussion on the transition from the the traditional distribution architecture toward the innovative Smart Grid is also included, paying attention to the challenges in front of distribution planners and decision makers at any level of the chain value. Emphasis is given to the enabling technologies required for the Smart Grid implementation. Indeed, advanced metering, intelligent electronic devices, and communication infrastructures assure the observability of the electric distribution system, an essential prerequisite for any efficient controllability. Energy storage systems are also crucial together with the other distributed energy resources to guarantee the sufficient level of flexibility for making the control also effective."
