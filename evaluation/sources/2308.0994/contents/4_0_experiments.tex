In this section, 
% we demonstrate the effectiveness of SYNAuG for data imbalance problems.
we evaluate our method for three sub-tasks: long-tailed recognition task (\Sref{sec:lt}), model fairness (\Sref{sec:fairness}), and model robustness to spurious correlation (\Sref{sec:robustness}).
% Additional results and details can be found in the supplementary material.
Through these results, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SYNAuG for data imbalance problems.
