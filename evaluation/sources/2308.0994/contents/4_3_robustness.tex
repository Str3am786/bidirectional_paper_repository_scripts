A class may include dominant patterns, \ie, spurious correlations.
For example, waterbirds are usually on water rather than land.
It leads DNNs to rely heavily on these spurious features rather than reasoning; thereby, DNNs classify water images as waterbirds regardless of the existence of waterbirds.
This spurious correlation is also caused by data imbalance because fewer waterbirds are located on land.
While spurious correlation occurs naturally, we can mitigate their impact by resolving data imbalance

\paragraph{Experiments.} 
We use Waterbirds dataset~\cite{sagawa2019distributionally}, which is a synthetic dataset created by combining images of birds from the CUB dataset~\cite{WelinderEtal2010} with backgrounds.
%The seabirds and waterfowl are grouped in a waterbird, and the other birds in a landbird.
The birds are grouped into two categories: waterbirds, which include seabirds and waterfowl, and landbirds.
Land and water background are spurious features.
Let $G_{\text{background}}^{\text{class}}$ be the class with the background, \eg, $G_{\text{water}}^{\text{landbird}}$ is the landbird with water background.
% where the class is waterbirds or landbirds, and the background is land or water.
% Let $G_1, G_2, G_3$, and $G_4$ be landbird with land background, landbird with water background, waterbird on land background, and waterbird with water background, respectively.
In the Waterbirds dataset, $G_{\text{land}}^{\text{landbird}}$ has more samples than $G_{\text{water}}^{\text{landbird}}$, and $G_{\text{water}}^{\text{waterbird}}$ has more samples than $G_{\text{land}}^{\text{waterbird}}$.
We generate the samples to match the number of samples such as $|G_{\text{land}}^{\text{landbird}}| = |G_{\text{water}}^{\text{landbird}}|$ and $|G_{\text{water}}^{\text{waterbird}}| = |G_{\text{land}}^{\text{waterbird}}|$.
% $G_1$ and $G_2$, and $G_3$ and $G_4$.
% Following Sagawa~\etal\cite{sagawa2019distributionally}, we evaluate algorithms using the minimum group accuracy and the average (in-distribution) accuracy, denoted as Worst and Mean, respectively.
We report the result over 5 independent runs using the code from DFR~\cite{kirichenko2023last}.
We reproduce the BaseModel and DFR and report the performance at the last epoch\footnote{\url{https://github.com/PolinaKirichenko/deep_feature_reweighting}}.

In \Tref{tab:robustness}, our SYNAuG generates samples not to be correlated with spurious features, which
improves the performance in BaseModel both on worst and mean accuracies.
When applying DFR, the synthetic data can increase the worst and mean accuracy consistently.
