\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We explored a relationship between 
the boosting algorithms for soft margin optimization 
and Frank-Wolfe algorithms via Fenchel duality. 
Using this unified view, 
we derived a scheme 
that can incorporate any secondary algorithm 
without losing the convergence guarantee. 
Even though our work is the fastest 
in the theoretically guaranteed boosting algorithms, 
LPBoost is still the fastest. 
We left the problem of inventing a faster boosting algorithm 
with a theoretical guarantee as future work.
