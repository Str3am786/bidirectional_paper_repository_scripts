Data augmentation is one of the most successful techniques to improve
the classification accuracy of machine learning models in computer
vision. However, applying data augmentation to \textit{tabular data}
is a challenging problem since it is hard to generate synthetic samples
with labels. In this paper, we propose an efficient classifier with
a novel data augmentation technique for tabular data. Our method called
\textbf{CCRAL} combines causal reasoning to learn counterfactual samples
for the original training samples and active learning to select useful
counterfactual samples based on a \textit{region of uncertainty.}
By doing this, our method can maximize our model's generalization
on the unseen testing data. We validate our method analytically, and
compare with the standard baselines. Our experimental results highlight
that \textbf{CCRAL} achieves significantly better performance than
those of the baselines across several real-world tabular datasets
in terms of accuracy and AUC. Data and source code are available at:
