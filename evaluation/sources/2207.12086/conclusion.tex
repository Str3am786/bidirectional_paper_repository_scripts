In this paper, we have introduced an efficient classifier (named \textbf{CCRAL})
with a novel data augmentation technique for tabular datasets. We
generate counterfactual data by flipping the binary value of the treatment
feature of original training samples, and obtain their labels by using
a matching method. We use active learning to select useful counterfactual
samples based on a \textit{region of uncertainty} depending on the
predicted scores of the original training samples. We augment selected
counterfactual samples to the set of original training samples to
train the classifier. We demonstrate the efficacy of \textbf{CCRAL}
on five standard real-world tabular datasets. The obtained results
show that \textbf{CCRAL} generalizes better and is more robust towards
unseen testing samples, where it significantly outperforms other methods.
Our approach can be conceptually extended to other types of data such
as sequences \cite{nguyen2018sqn2vec} and graphs \cite{nguyen2018learning}.
