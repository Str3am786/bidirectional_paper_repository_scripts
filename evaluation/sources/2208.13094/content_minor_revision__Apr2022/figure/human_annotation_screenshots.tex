  \caption{\textbf{A:} The interface for introducing the task description and eight macro norms to a new annotator. The definitions for each norms are shown one by one, accompanied by gold-standard examples that violate the norm. \textbf{B:} The interface for training and testing new annotators. Once the new annotators select their annotation, the correct annotation is shown accompanied by gold-standard examples. The interface for the main annotation task is the same but without presenting the correct annotation portion.}
