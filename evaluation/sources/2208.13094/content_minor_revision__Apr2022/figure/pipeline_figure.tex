  \caption{An illustration of the human-AI pipeline for identifying violating comments. Our pipeline includes 97 subreddit classifiers that are trained using a balanced dataset of moderated and unmoderated comments, and human annotators who are trained through gated instruction~\cite{25_Liu}. Our classifiers (tuned for high recall) nominate potentially violating comments and human annotators make the final determination.}
