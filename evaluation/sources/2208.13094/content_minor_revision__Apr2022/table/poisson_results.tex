\captionof{table}{The results of Poisson regression that predicts the rate of problematic comments in a subreddit. We find that the number of comments in a subreddit, as well as a few of the topic categories are strong predictors of the rate of problematic comments a subreddit may have. The topic "general content", which was included in the model, is not shown as it was used as the baseline dummy variable for the categorical variable.}
