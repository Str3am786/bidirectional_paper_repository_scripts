We describe the observing system and report on the non-detection of any FRBs from that time until 2017 August for a total observing time of 518 h. With current FRB rate models, along with measurements of telescope sensitivity and beam size, we estimate that this survey probed redshifts out to about 3.4 with an effective survey volume of around 600 000 Mpc3. Based on this, we would expect, at the 99 per cent confidence level, to see at most two FRBs. We discuss the implications of this non-detection in the context of results from other telescopes and the limitation of our search pipeline. During the survey, single pulses from 17 known pulsars were detected. We also report the discovery of a Galactic radio transient with a pulse width of 3 ms and dispersion measure of 281 pc cm−3, which was detected while the telescope was slewing between fields.}",

By using a real-time FRB detection system, we captured raw voltages for five of the six events, which allowed for coherent dedispersion and very high time resolution (10.24 \\$\\mu\\$s) studies of the bursts. Five of the FRBs show temporal broadening consistent with interstellar and/or intergalactic scattering, with scattering time-scales ranging from 0.16 to 29.1 ms. One burst, FRB181017, shows remarkable temporal structure, with three peaks each separated by 1 ms. We searched for phase-coherence between the leading and trailing peaks and found none, ruling out lensing scenarios. Based on this survey, we calculate an all-sky rate at 843 MHz of \\$98^\\{+59\\}\_\\{-39\\}\\$ events sky−1 d−1 to a fluence limit of 8 Jy ms: a factor of 7 below the rates estimated from the Parkes and ASKAP telescopes at 1.4 GHz assuming the ASKAP-derived spectral index α = −1.6 (Fν ∝ να). Our results suggest that FRB spectra may turn over below 1 GHz. Optical, radio, and X-ray follow-up has been made for most of the reported bursts, with no associated transients found. No repeat bursts were found in the survey.}",

	abstract = {In the modern era of big data, many fields of astronomy are generating huge volumes of data, the analysis of which can sometimes be the limiting factor in research. Fortunately, computer scientists have developed powerful data-mining techniques that can be applied to various fields. In this paper, we present a novel artificial intelligence (AI) program that identifies pulsars from recent surveys by using image pattern recognition with deep neural nets—the PICS  (Pulsar Image-based Classification System) AI. The AI mimics human experts and distinguishes pulsars from noise and interference by looking for patterns from candidate plots. Different from other pulsar selection programs that search for expected patterns, the PICS AI is taught the salient features of different pulsars from a set of human-labeled candidates through machine learning. The training candidates are collected from the Pulsar Arecibo L-band Feed Array (PALFA) survey. The information from each pulsar candidate is synthesized in four diagnostic plots, which consist of image data with up to thousands of pixels. The AI takes these data from each candidate as its input and uses thousands of such candidates to train its ∼9000 neurons. The deep neural networks in this AI system grant it superior ability to recognize various types of pulsars as well as their harmonic signals. The trained AI's performance has been validated with a large set of candidates from a different pulsar survey, the Green Bank North Celestial Cap survey. In this completely independent test, the PICS ranked 264 out of 277 pulsar-related candidates, including all 56 previously known pulsars and 208 of their harmonics, in the top 961 (1\%) of 90,008 test candidates, missing only 13 harmonics. The first non-pulsar candidate appears at rank 187, following 45 pulsars and 141 harmonics. In other words, 100\% of the pulsars were ranked in the top 1\% of all candidates, while 80\% were ranked higher than any noise or interference. The performance of this system can be improved over time as more training data are accumulated. This AI system has been integrated into the PALFA survey pipeline and has discovered six new pulsars to date.}

	abstract = {We present a new model for the distribution of free electrons in the Galaxy, the Magellanic Clouds, and the intergalactic medium (IGM) that can be used to estimate distances to real or simulated pulsars and fast radio bursts (FRBs) based on their dispersion measure (DM). The Galactic model has an extended thick disk representing the so-called warm interstellar medium, a thin disk representing the Galactic molecular ring, spiral arms based on a recent fit to Galactic H ii regions, a Galactic Center disk, and seven local features including the Gum Nebula, Galactic Loop I, and the Local Bubble. An offset of the Sun from the Galactic plane and a warp of the outer Galactic disk are included in the model. Parameters of the Galactic model are determined by fitting to 189 pulsars with independently determined distances and DMs. Simple models are used for the Magellanic Clouds and the IGM. Galactic model distances are within the uncertainty range for 86 of the 189 independently determined distances and within 20\% of the nearest limit for a further 38 pulsars. We estimate that 95\% of predicted Galactic pulsar distances will have a relative error of less than a factor of 0.9. The predictions of YMW16 are compared to those of the TC93 and NE2001 models showing that YMW16 performs significantly better on all measures. Timescales for pulse broadening due to interstellar scattering are estimated for (real or simulated) Galactic and Magellanic Cloud pulsars and FRBs.}

	abstract = {A large number of observations from the Parkes 64 m diameter radio telescope, recorded with high time resolution, are publicly available. We have reprocessed all of the observations obtained during the first four years (from 1997–2001) of the Parkes Multibeam Receiver system in order to identify transient events, and have built a database that records the 568,736,756 pulse candidates generated during this search. We have discovered a new fast radio burst (FRB), FRB 010305, with a dispersion measure (DM) of 350 ± 5 cm−3 pc and explored why so few FRBs have been discovered in data prior to 2001. After accounting for the dispersion smearing across the channel bandwidth and the sky regions surveyed, the number of FRBs is found to be consistent with model predictions. We also present five single pulse candidates from unknown sources, but with Galactic DMs. We extract a diverse range of sources from the database, which can be used, for example, as a training set of data for new software being developed to search for FRBs in the presence of radio frequency interference.}

It uses a 13-beam receiver on the 64-m Parkes radio telescope, receiving two polarizations per beam over a 288-MHz bandwidth centred on 1374 MHz. The receiver and data acquisition systems are described in some detail. For pulsar periods in the range  and dispersion measures of less than 300 cm−3 pc, the nominal limiting flux density of the survey is about 0.2 mJy. At shorter or longer periods or higher dispersions, the sensitivity is reduced. Timing observations are carried out for pulsars discovered in the survey for  months after confirmation to obtain accurate positions, spin parameters, dispersion measures, pulse shapes and mean flux densities. The survey is proving to be extremely successful, with more than 600 pulsars discovered so far. We expect that, when complete, this one survey will come close to finding as many pulsars as all previous pulsar surveys put together. The newly discovered pulsars tend to be young, distant and of high radio luminosity. They will form a valuable sample for studies of pulsar emission properties, the Galactic distribution and evolution of pulsars, and as probes of interstellar medium properties. This paper reports the timing and pulse shape parameters for the first 100 pulsars timed at Parkes, including three pulsars with periods of less than 100 ms which are members of binary systems. These results are briefly compared with the parameters of the previously known population.}",
