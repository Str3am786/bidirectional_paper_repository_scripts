\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we studied the transaction tracing problem on account-based blockchain trading systems and proposed the first intelligent transaction tracing tool named TRacer. Compared with existing methods based on heuristics and taint analysis, which usually requires expert experience and manual intervention, TRacer show obvious superiority in terms of universality, effectiveness and time cost. In TRacer, we first formulated the transaction records in each account-based blockchain as a directed, weighted, temporal, and multi-relationship graph, which is able to represent the rich semantics of complex multi-token transaction relationships in the system. Then we proposed to use personalized PageRank-based graph searching technologies on this complex graph to trace the money flows. Specifically, we introduced novel approximate personalized PageRank strategies to realize effective and low-cost transaction tracing, which can also handle the complex DeFi transaction actions in account-based blockchains. The theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of TRacer. 
% However, TRacer still cannot trace the fund flow using privacy enhancement technology, especially the mixing services such as Tornado Cash.
In the future, we will further delve into blockchain transaction tracing by integrating more transaction features like bytecodes and logs and design effective methods for blockchain systems with privacy-enhancing mechanisms.
% Moreover, our method can capture the subgraph of the source node, which will be used to carry out more effective node classification in future work.
