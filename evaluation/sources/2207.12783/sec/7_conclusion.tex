In this paper, we present EIGV --- a model-agnostic explainer, that empowers the SoTA VideoQA model with intrinsic interpretability. In the light of the causality, we formulate our learning principles --- causal-equivariance and environment-invariance by incorporating three constituents, the grounding indicator, the intervener, and the disruptor, which manage a robust rationale discovery. Experiments across three benchmarks validate EIGV's fulfillment in both interpretation and accuracy.

% In addition to the technical advantages, we discuss possible refinements to improve the current design. Unlike some SoTAs that utilize object-level features (\eg HOSTR \cite{dang2021hierarchical} and PGAT \cite{DBLP:conf/mm/PengYBW21}), EIVG merely takes advantage of clip-level representation. Although the architecture of the backbone model is beyond the scope of this work, we anticipate that a fine-grained interpretation at the entity level will strengthen the current EIGV design.
