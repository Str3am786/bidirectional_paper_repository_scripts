\section{Limitation and Complexity}
\label{section:limits}
\lyc{In addition to the technical advantages, we discuss possible limits of the current design. Unlike some SoTAs that utilize object-level features (\eg HOSTR \cite{dang2021hierarchical} and PGAT \cite{DBLP:conf/mm/PengYBW21}), EIVG merely takes advantage of clip-level representation. Although the architecture of the backbone model is beyond the scope of this work, we anticipate that a fine-grained interpretation at the entity level will strengthen the current EIGV design.
% 2) Current intervention strategy can possibly threaten the causal prediction by introducing context with new shortcuts. Since the scene intervener sample context stratification in a random manner, there is a slight chance to draw an undesired substitute that nested with strong static relation towards  a wrong answer, thus inducing a false prediction.
In terms of complexity, we run all experiments on NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU, where our algorithm matched equally with the corresponding baseline.  For comparison, the backbone MSPAN model is trained for 1.5 hours till convergence on NExT-QA, whereas EIGV 
takes 1.6 hours.
