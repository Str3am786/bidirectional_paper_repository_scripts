	abstract = {Chirality is associated with the breaking of symmetry, often described as left- or right-handed behavior. Such asymmetry can be seen, for example, in the electronic responses of particular materials or the reactions between particular chemical species. Zhu et al. observed a chiral phonon mode in a monolayer of the transition metal dichalcogenide WSe2, detected spectroscopically as the circular dichroism of the phonon-assisted transition of holes. Phonon chirality could be used to control the electron-phonon coupling and/or the phonon-driven topological states of solids.Science, this issue p. 579Chirality reveals symmetry breaking of the fundamental interaction of elementary particles. In condensed matter, for example, the chirality of electrons governs many unconventional transport phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect. Here we show that phonons can exhibit intrinsic chirality in monolayer tungsten diselenide. The broken inversion symmetry of the lattice lifts the degeneracy of clockwise and counterclockwise phonon modes at the corners of the Brillouin zone. We identified the phonons by the intervalley transfer of holes through hole-phonon interactions during the indirect infrared absorption, and we confirmed their chirality by the infrared circular dichroism arising from pseudoangular momentum conservation. The chiral phonons are important for electron-phonon coupling in solids, phonon-driven topological states, and energy-efficient information processing.},

abstract="In order to study the vibrational properties of harmonic disordered solids we consider two models for disorder: Randomly fluctuating elastic constants (intrinsic disorder) and coupling to local oscillators (defects) with random eigen frequencies. The first model is treated in self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA), whereas the second can be solved exactly. This enables us to discuss the accuracy of the SCBA. In both models an enhancement of the low-frequency vibrational density of states over that predicted by Debye is obtained (''boson peak'') as a result of the presence of the disorder. In the frequency regime above the boson peak an almost exponential decrease of the reduced density of states is obtained, which is widely observed in experiments. Whereas the gross features of the models are similar, the details can be different, depending on the model parameters chosen.",

properties of disordered solids based on the model assumption of
randomly fluctuating transverse elastic constants is presented. 
Mean-field expressions for the vibrational density of states and the
energy diffusivity are derived with field-theoretical techniques.
As in previous approaches of this type the boson peak
(enhancement of the low-frequency density of states) is
explained as a result of the frozen-in disorder and compares
well with the experimental findings.
The plateau in the temperature variation of the thermal conductivity and the
behavior beyond the plateau
is shown to arise from the enhanced scattering in the boson peak
regime and to be essentially a harmonic phenomenon.}

	abstract = {The low-temperature thermal properties of dielectric crystals are governed by acoustic excitations with large wavelengths that are well described by plane waves. This is the Debye model, which rests on the assumption that the medium is an elastic continuum, holds true for acoustic wavelengths large on the microscopic scale fixed by the interatomic spacing, and gradually breaks down on approaching it. Glasses are characterized as well by universal low-temperature thermal properties that are, however, anomalous with respect to those of the corresponding crystalline phases. Related universal anomalies also appear in the low-frequency vibrational density of states and, despite a longstanding debate, remain poorly understood. By using molecular dynamics simulations of a model monatomic glass of extremely large size, we show that in glasses the structural disorder undermines the Debye model in a subtle way: The elastic continuum approximation for the acoustic excitations breaks down abruptly on the mesoscopic, medium-range-order length scale of ≈10 interatomic spacings, where it still works well for the corresponding crystalline systems. On this scale, the sound velocity shows a marked reduction with respect to the macroscopic value. This reduction turns out to be closely related to the universal excess over the Debye model prediction found in glasses at frequencies of ≈1 THz in the vibrational density of states or at temperatures of ≈10 K in the specific heat.},

abstract={The local elasticity of glasses is known to be inhomogeneous on a microscopic scale compared to that of crystalline materials. Their vibrational spectrum strongly deviates from that expected from Debye's elasticity theory: The density of states deviates from Debye's law, the sound velocity shows a negative dispersion in the boson-peak frequency regime and there is a strong increase of the sound attenuation near the boson-peak frequency. By comparing a mean-field theory of shear-elastic heterogeneity with a large-scale simulation of a soft-sphere glass we demonstrate that the observed anomalies in glasses are caused by elastic heterogeneity. By observing that the macroscopic bulk modulus is frequency independent we show that the boson-peak-related vibrational anomalies are predominantly due to the spatially fluctuating microscopic shear stresses. It is demonstrated that the boson-peak arises from the steep increase of the sound attenuation at a frequency which marks the transition from wave-like excitations to disorder-dominated ones.},

In contrast, years of effort have failed to provide a convincing picture for vibrations in disordered solids. We provide a contribution to this issue by reporting clear evidence that a mechanical feature, elastic heterogeneity at the nanoscale, profoundly affects the main properties and even the very nature of sound waves. Our picklock is the numerical study of a toy model that, at fixed macroscopic thermodynamical conditions, allows to investigate in a unified framework the perfect crystal, increasingly defective ordered phases, and the fully developed amorphous state.In the recent years, much attention has been devoted to the inhomogeneous nature of the mechanical response at the nanoscale in disordered solids. Clearly, the elastic heterogeneities that have been characterized in this context are expected to strongly affect the nature of the sound waves which, in contrast to the case of perfect crystals, cannot be completely rationalized in terms of phonons. Building on previous work on a toy model showing an amorphization transition, we investigate the relationship between sound waves and elastic heterogeneities in a unified framework by continuously interpolating from the perfect crystal, through increasingly defective phases, to fully developed glasses. We provide strong evidence of a direct correlation between sound wave features and the extent of the heterogeneous mechanical response at the nanoscale.},

abstract  ="Understanding the difference between the universal low-temperature properties of amorphous and crystalline solids requires an explanation for the stronger damping of long-wavelength phonons in amorphous solids. A longstanding sound attenuation scenario{,} resulting from a combination of experiments{,} theories{,} and simulations{,} leads to a quartic scaling of sound attenuation with the wavevector{,} which is commonly attributed to the Rayleigh scattering of sound. Modern computer simulations offer conflicting conclusions regarding the validity of this picture. We simulate glasses with an unprecedentedly broad range of stabilities to perform the first microscopic analysis of sound damping in model glass formers across a range of experimentally relevant preparation protocols. We present convincing evidence that quartic scaling is recovered for small wavevectors irrespective of the glass{'}s stability. With increasing stability{,} the wavevector where the quartic scaling begins increases by approximately a factor of three and the sound attenuation decreases by over an order of magnitude. Our results uncover an intimate connection between glass stability and sound damping."}

An effective medium approximation is made to compute the density of states of the vibrational modes, their energy diffusivity (a spectral measure of transport) and their spatial correlations as the network coordination z is varied. Critical behaviors are obtained as z→zc where these networks lose rigidity. A sharp crossover from a regime where modes are plane-wave–like toward a regime of extended but strongly scattered modes occurs at some frequency ω*∼z-zc, which does not correspond to the Ioffe-Regel criterion. Above ω* both the density of states and the diffusivity are nearly constant. These results agree remarkably with recent numerical observations of repulsive particles near the jamming threshold (Xu N. et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 102 (2009) 038001). The analysis further predicts that the length scale characterizing the correlation of displacements of the scattered modes decays as  with frequency, whereas for ω≪ω* Rayleigh scattering is found with a scattering length ls∼(z-zc)3/ω4. It is argued that this description applies to silica glass where it compares well with thermal conductivity data, and to transverse ultrasound propagation in granular matter.}

In various amorphous materials{,} mechanical stability can be lost either by reducing connectedness or by increasing pressure. We present an effective medium theory of elasticity that extends previous approaches by incorporating the effect of compression{,} of amplitude e{,} allowing one to describe quantitative features of sound propagation{,} transport{,} the boson peak{,} and elastic moduli near the elastic instability occurring at a compression ec. The theory disentangles several frequencies characterizing the vibrational spectrum: the onset frequency where strongly-scattered modes appear in the vibrational spectrum{,} the pressure-independent frequency ω* where the density of states displays a plateau{,} the boson peak frequency ωBP found to scale as {,} and the Ioffe–Regel frequency ωIR where scattering length and wavelength become equal. We predict that sound attenuation crosses over from ω4 to ω2 behaviour at ω0{,} consistent with observations in glasses. We predict that a frequency-dependent length scale ls(ω) and speed of sound ν(ω) characterize vibrational modes{,} and could be extracted from scattering data. One key result is the prediction of a flat diffusivity above ω0{,} in agreement with previously unexplained observations. We find that the shear modulus does not vanish at the elastic instability{,} but drops by a factor of 2. We check our predictions in packings of soft particles and study the case of covalent networks and silica{,} for which we predict ωIR ≈ ωBP. Overall{,} our approach unifies sound attenuation{,} transport and length scales entering elasticity in a single framework where disorder is not the main parameter controlling the boson peak{,} in agreement with observations. This framework leads to a phase diagram where various glasses can be placed{,} connecting microscopic structure to vibrational properties."}
