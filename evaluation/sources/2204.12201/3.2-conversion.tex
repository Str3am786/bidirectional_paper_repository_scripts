\subsection{Bridging modular and bit-level arithmetic}\label{ss:bridging}

Declaring variables with a protected integral type and using solely bit-level arithmetic as in Listing~\ref{list:fibs} has a potential drawback: When an FHE scheme provides fast modular arithmetic operations, the usage of circuits operating on separate bits is slow. This paper brings the  idea of 
\textit{Bridging} - mixing both modular and bit-level arithmetic in one program with the ability to convert variables from one type to the other. %integral type to modular.
Some variables can be declared using a protected type supporting only modular arithmetic, while others with another secure type supporting bit-level arithmetic. In bridging mode, a type of bit-level arithmetic declares a conversion function into a type of modular arithmetic, and vice-versa.
In all cases, the encryption of the two different C++ types must share the same FHE keys, which is ensured by our proposed methodology and framework.
