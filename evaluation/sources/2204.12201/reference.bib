abstract = {Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows computing on encrypted data, enabling secure offloading of computation to untrusted servers. Though it provides ideal security, FHE is expensive when executed in software, 4 to 5 orders of magnitude slower than computing on unencrypted data. These overheads are a major barrier to FHE’s widespread adoption. We present F1, the first FHE accelerator that is programmable, i.e., capable of executing full FHE programs. F1 builds on an in-depth architectural analysis of the characteristics of FHE computations that reveals acceleration opportunities. F1 is a wide-vector processor with novel functional units deeply specialized to FHE primitives, such as modular arithmetic, number-theoretic transforms, and structured permutations. This organization provides so much compute throughput that data movement becomes the key bottleneck. Thus, F1 is primarily designed to minimize data movement. Hardware provides an explicitly managed memory hierarchy and mechanisms to decouple data movement from execution. A novel compiler leverages these mechanisms to maximize reuse and schedule off-chip and on-chip data movement. We evaluate F1 using cycle-accurate simulation and RTL synthesis. F1 is the first system to accelerate complete FHE programs, and outperforms state-of-the-art software implementations by gmean 5,400 \texttimes{} and by up to 17,000 \texttimes{}. These speedups counter most of FHE’s overheads and enable new applications, like real-time private deep learning in the cloud. },

abstract = {Summary
Genotype imputation is the inference of unknown genotypes using known population structure observed in large genomic datasets; it can further our understanding of phenotype-genotype relationships and is useful for QTL mapping and GWASs. However, the compute-intensive nature of genotype imputation can overwhelm local servers for computation and storage. Hence, many researchers are moving toward using cloud services, raising privacy concerns. We address these concerns by developing an efficient, privacy-preserving algorithm called p−Impute. Our method uses homomorphic encryption, allowing calculations on ciphertext, thereby avoiding the decryption of private genotypes in the cloud. It is similar to k-nearest neighbor approaches, inferring missing genotypes in a genomic block based on the SNP genotypes of genetically related individuals in the same block. Our results demonstrate accuracy in agreement with the state-of-the-art plaintext solutions. Moreover, p−Impute is scalable to real-world applications as its memory and time requirements increase linearly with the increasing number of samples. p−Impute is freely available for download here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5542001.}

abstract = {The world is undergoing an unprecedented technological transformation, evolving into a state where ubiquitous Internet-enabled “things” will be able to generate and share large amounts of security- and privacy-sensitive data. To cope with the security threats that are thus foreseeable, system designers can find in Arm TrustZone hardware technology a most valuable resource. TrustZone is a System-on-Chip and CPU system-wide security solution, available on today’s Arm application processors and present in the new generation Arm microcontrollers, which are expected to dominate the market of smart “things.” Although this technology has remained relatively underground since its inception in 2004, over the past years, numerous initiatives have significantly advanced the state of the art involving Arm TrustZone. Motivated by this revival of interest, this paper presents an in-depth study of TrustZone technology. We provide a comprehensive survey of relevant work from academia and industry, presenting existing systems into two main areas, namely, Trusted Execution Environments and hardware-assisted virtualization. Furthermore, we analyze the most relevant weaknesses of existing systems and propose new research directions within the realm of tiniest devices and the Internet of Things, which we believe to have potential to yield high-impact contributions in the future.},

abstract = {In this paper trade-offs among certain computational factors in hash coding are analyzed. The paradigm problem considered is that of testing a series of messages one-by-one for membership in a given set of messages. Two new hash-coding methods are examined and compared with a particular conventional hash-coding method. The computational factors considered are the size of the hash area (space), the time required to identify a message as a nonmember of the given set (reject time), and an allowable error frequency.The new methods are intended to reduce the amount of space required to contain the hash-coded information from that associated with conventional methods. The reduction in space is accomplished by exploiting the possibility that a small fraction of errors of commission may be tolerable in some applications, in particular, applications in which a large amount of data is involved and a core resident hash area is consequently not feasible using conventional methods.In such applications, it is envisaged that overall performance could be improved by using a smaller core resident hash area in conjunction with the new methods and, when necessary, by using some secondary and perhaps time-consuming test to “catch” the small fraction of errors associated with the new methods. An example is discussed which illustrates possible areas of application for the new methods.Analysis of the paradigm problem demonstrates that allowing a small number of test messages to be falsely identified as members of the given set will permit a much smaller hash area to be used without increasing reject time.},
