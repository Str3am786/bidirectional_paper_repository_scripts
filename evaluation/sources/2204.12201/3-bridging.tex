\section{Proposed Bridging Methodology}\label{s:bridging}

We define new data types to abstract the low-level complexity of the encryption scheme and Boolean circuits.
This is possible by extending the  E3 framework \cite{e3eprint}, which is one level of abstraction above FHE libraries and enables portability of code across different libraries.
