    abstract = {From robots to autonomous vehicles, the design of artificial moral agents (AMAs) is an area of growing interest to HCI, and rising concern for the implications of deploying moral machines raises questions about which ethical frameworks are being used in AMAs. We performed a literature review to identify and synthesize key themes in how ethical theories have been applied to AMAs. We reviewed 53 papers and performed a thematic analysis to describe and synthesize the current conversation across HCI. We found many describe the value of ethical theories and implement them as technical contributions, but very few conduct empirical studies in real settings. Furthermore, we found AMA development is dominated by two ethical theories: deontology and consequentialism. We argue that the focus on deontology and consequentialism risks creating AMAs based on a narrow set of Western ethical values and concepts at the expense of other forms of moral reasoning.},

               become a classic text in biomedical ethics. Major structural
               changes mark the revision. The authors have added a new
               concluding chapter on methods that, along with its companion
               chapter on moral theory, emphasizes convergence across theories,
               coherence in moral justification, and the common morality. They
               have simplified the opening chapter on moral norms which
               introduces the framework of prima facie moral principles and
               ways to specify and balance them. Together with the shift of
               advanced material on theory to the back of the book, this
               heavily revised introductory chapter will make it easier for the
               wide range of students entering bioethics courses to use this
               text. Another important change is the increased emphasis on
               character and moral agency, drawing the distinction between
               agents and actions. The sections on truth telling, disclosure of
               bad news, privacy, conflicts of interest, and research on human
               subjects have also been throughly reworked. The four core
               chapters on principles (respect for autonomy, nonmaleficence,
               beneficence, and justice) and the chapter on
               professional-patient relationships retain their familiar
               structure, but the authors have completely updated their content
               to reflect developments in philosophical analysis as well as in
               research, medicine, and health care. Throughout, they have used
               a number of actual cases to illuminate and to test their theory,
               method, and framework of principles.",

abstract = { Code reuse is traditionally seen as good practice. Recent trends have pushed the
idea of code reuse to an extreme, by using packages that implement simple and trivial
tasks, which we call ‘trivial packages’. A recent incident where a trivial package
led to the breakdown of some of the most popular web applications such as Facebook
and Netflix, put the spotlight on whether using trivial packages should be encouraged.
Therefore, in this research, we mine more than 230,000 npm packages and 38,000 JavaScript
projects in order to study the prevalence of trivial packages. We found that trivial
packages are common, making up 16.8% of the studied npm packages. We performed a survey
with 88 Node.js developers who use trivial packages to understand the reasons for
and drawbacks of their use. We found that trivial packages are used because they are
perceived to be well-implemented and tested pieces of code. However, developers are
concerned about maintaining and the risks of breakages due to the extra dependencies
trivial packages introduce. },

abstract = {The reuse of third-party packages has become a common practice in contemporary software
development. Software dependencies are constantly evolving with newly added features
and patches that fix bugs in older versions. However, updating dependencies could
introduce new bugs or break backward compatibility. In this work, we propose a technique
to detect breakage-inducing versions of third-party dependencies. The key insight
behind our approach is to leverage the automated test suites of other projects that
depend upon the same dependency to test newly released versions. We conjecture that
this crowd-based approach will help to detect breakage-inducing versions because it
broadens the set of realistic usage scenarios to which a package version has been
exposed. To evaluate our conjecture, we perform an empirical study of 391,553 npm
packages. We use the dependency network from these packages to identify candidate
tests of third-party packages. Moreover, to evaluate our proposed technique, we mine
the history of this dependency network to identify ten breakage-inducing versions.
We find that our proposed technique can detect six of the ten studied breakage-inducing
versions. Our findings can help developers to make more informed decisions when they
update their dependencies.},

abstract = {Question answering (Q&amp;A) websites are now large repositories of valuable knowledge. While most Q&amp;A sites were initially aimed at providing useful answers to the question asker, there has been a marked shift towards question answering as a community-driven knowledge creation process whose end product can be of enduring value to a broad audience. As part of this shift, specific expertise and deep knowledge of the subject at hand have become increasingly important, and many Q&amp;A sites employ voting and reputation mechanisms as centerpieces of their design to help users identify the trustworthiness and accuracy of the content.To better understand this shift in focus from one-off answers to a group knowledge-creation process, we consider a question together with its entire set of corresponding answers as our fundamental unit of analysis, in contrast with the focus on individual question-answer pairs that characterized previous work. Our investigation considers the dynamics of the community activity that shapes the set of answers, both how answers and voters arrive over time and how this influences the eventual outcome. For example, we observe significant assortativity in the reputations of co-answerers, relationships between reputation and answer speed, and that the probability of an answer being chosen as the best one strongly depends on temporal characteristics of answer arrivals. We then show that our understanding of such properties is naturally applicable to predicting several important quantities, including the long-term value of the question and its answers, as well as whether a question requires a better answer. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for the design of Q&amp;A sites.},

abstract = {The selection of third-party libraries is an essential element of virtually any software development project. However, deciding which libraries to choose is a challenging practical problem. Selecting the wrong library can severely impact a software project in terms of cost, time, and development effort, with the severity of the impact depending on the role of the library in the software architecture, among others. Despite the importance of following a careful library selection process, in practice, the selection of third-party libraries is still conducted in an ad-hoc manner, where dozens of factors play an influential role in the decision.  In this paper, we study the factors that influence the selection process of libraries, as perceived by industry developers. To that aim, we perform a cross-sectional interview study with 16 developers from 11 different businesses and survey 115 developers that are involved in the selection of libraries. We systematically devised a comprehensive set of 26 technical, human, and economic factors that developers take into consideration when selecting a software library. Eight of these factors are new to the literature. We explain each of these factors and how they play a role in the decision. Finally, we discuss the implications of our work to library maintainers, potential library users, package manager developers, and empirical software engineering researchers.},
