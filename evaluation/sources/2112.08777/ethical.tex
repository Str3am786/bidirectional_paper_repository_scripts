\section*{Ethical Considerations}
Our work in understanding the role of maximizing the similarity between question and evidence pairs. Therefore, there is a limited risk associated with the quality of annotated evidence sentences in the dataset, as there is no guarantee that our model will always
generate non-biased and factual content. Therefore, caution must
be exercised when the model is deployed in practical settings, where the evidence quality is vague and cannot be verified.
