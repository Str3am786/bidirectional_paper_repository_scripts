\subsection{GZSL Datasets}

We use three datasets. \textit{Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 (\textbf{CUB})} \cite{CUB}, a fine-grained dataset with $11,788$ images from $200$ different types of birds annotated corresponding to $150$ seen and $50$ unseen classes, with $312$ attributes. \textit{SUN Attribute (\textbf{SUN})} \cite{SUN}, a fine-grained dataset with $14,340$ images from $717$ types of scenes corresponding to $645$ seen and $72$ unseen classes, annotated with $102$ attributes. \textit{Animals with Attributes2 (\textbf{AWA2})} \cite{AWA2}, a dataset with $37,322$ images from $50$ animal classes corresponding to $40$ seen and $10$ unseen classes, annotated with $85$ attributes. We report the \textit{seen} and \textit{unseen} accuracy, and their harmonic mean.
