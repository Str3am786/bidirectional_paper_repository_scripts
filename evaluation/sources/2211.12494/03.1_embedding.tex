\subsection{Embedding-based Methods}

\textit{\textbf{DeViSE}: A Deep Visual-Semantic Embedding Model}~\cite{DeViSE} (2013) propose to learn a linear mapping between the image and the semantic space and introduce the use of a ranking loss instead of an L$_2$ loss. This avoids making the vectors become closer to one another without taking into account the incorrect labels that are closer to the target image.

\textit{An embarrassingly simple approach to zero-shot learning (\textbf{ESZSL})}~\cite{ESZSL} (2015) use a linear model to create relationships between features, attributes and classes. This linear model has two layers, the first layer  helps in defining the relationship between features and attributes, and the second layer deals with modeling the relationship between attributes and classes where the prescribed attribute signatures are fixed. This method uses a square loss to learn the bilinear compatibility between attributes and their corresponding classes. 

\textit{Label-Embedding for Image Classification} present an \textit{Attribute Label Embedding approach (\textbf{ALE})}~\cite{ALE} (2016), they propose to embed each class in the space of attribute vectors, and further propose to learn a bilinear compatibility function between the image and a label embedding using a ranking objective function.
