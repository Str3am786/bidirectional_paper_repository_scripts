\section{Appendix}

In Section~\ref{sec:implementation_details} we show implementation details with hyperparameter selections for all GZSL methods, and detail the computing infrastructure we use while conducting all of our experiments. 
Then we show in fine-tuning information for the multi-modal backbone in Section~\ref{sec:prompt_engineering_text}.
We also show extended results for all of our experiments using all features from different backbones and methods in Section~\ref{sec:all_tables}.
Lastly, we discuss about some ethical considerations and the importance of Generalized Zero-Shot Learning in Section~\ref{ethical}.
