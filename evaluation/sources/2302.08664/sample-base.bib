abstract = {The optimisation of software energy consumption is of growing importance across all scales of modern computing, i.e., from embedded systems to data-centres. Practitioners in the field of Search-Based Software Engineering and Genetic Improvement of Software acknowledge that optimising software energy consumption is difficult due to noisy and expensive fitness evaluations. However, it is apparent from results to date that more progress needs to be made in rigorously validating optimisation results. This problem is pressing because modern computing platforms have highly complex and variable behaviour with respect to energy consumption. To compare solutions fairly we propose in this paper a new validation approach called R3-validation which exercises software variants in a rotated-round-robin order. Using a case study, we present an in-depth analysis of the impacts of changing system states on software energy usage, and we show how R3-validation mitigates these. We compare it with current validation approaches across multiple devices and operating systems, and we show that it aligns best with actual platform behaviour.},

abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms have successfully been applied to evolve problem instances that exhibit a significant difference in performance for a given algorithm or a pair of algorithms inter alia for the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). Creating a large variety of instances is crucial for successful applications in the blooming field of algorithm selection. In this paper, we introduce new and creative mutation operators for evolving instances of the TSP. We show that adopting those operators in an evolutionary algorithm allows for the generation of benchmark sets with highly desirable properties: (1) novelty by clear visual distinction to established benchmark sets in the field, (2) visual and quantitative diversity in the space of TSP problem characteristics, and (3) significant performance differences with respect to the restart versions of heuristic state-of-the-art TSP solvers EAX and LKH. The important aspect of diversity is addressed and achieved solely by the proposed mutation operators and not enforced by explicit diversity preservation.},

With this paper, we bridge the areas of evolutionary diversity optimization and evolutionary multi-objective optimization. We show how popular indicators frequently used in the area of multi-objective optimization can be used for evolutionary diversity optimization. Our experimental investigations for evolving diverse sets of TSP instances and images according to various features show that two of the most prominent multi-objective indicators, namely the hypervolume indicator and the inverted generational distance, provide excellent results in terms of visualization and various diversity indicators.},

abstract = {Despite significant empirical and theoretically supported evidence that non-static parameter choices can be strongly beneficial in evolutionary computation, the question how to best adjust parameter values plays only a marginal role in contemporary research on discrete black-box optimization. This has led to the unsatisfactory situation in which feedback-free parameter selection rules such as the cooling schedule of Simulated Annealing are predominant in state-of-the-art heuristics, while, at the same time, we understand very well that such time-dependent selection rules can not perform as well as adjustment rules that do take into account the evolution of the optimization process. A number of adaptive and self-adaptive parameter control strategies have been proposed in the literature, but did not (yet) make their way to a broader public. A key obstacle seems to lie in their rather complex update rules.The purpose of our work is to demonstrate that high-performing online parameter selection rules do not have to be very complicated. More precisely, we experiment with a multiplicative, comparison-based update rule to adjust the mutation rate of a (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm. We show that this simple self-adjusting rule outperforms the best static unary unbiased black-box algorithm on LeadingOnes, achieving an almost optimal speedup of about 18%. We also observe promising performance on the OneMax benchmark problem.},
