abstract = {Developers perform small-scale reuse tasks to save time and to increase the quality of their code. Due to the small scale of such tasks, the overhead in reusing source code can quickly outweigh the benefits. Existing approaches focus on locating source code for reuse but do not support the integration of the located code within the developer's system, thereby leaving the developer with the burden of performing these steps manually. This paper presents a tool, called Jigsaw, that uses the developer's context to help integrate the reused source code into the developer's own source code.},
